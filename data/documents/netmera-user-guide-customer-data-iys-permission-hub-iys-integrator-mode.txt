Customer Data
IYS Permission Hub
IYS Integrator Mode
The
IYS Integrator Mode
enables businesses to treat Netmera as the master system of record for user communication consents. It allows Netmera to create, update, and sync user permission data with Turkey’s official İleti Yönetim Sistemi (İYS), given that mutual authorization is granted through the IYS portal.
This module is particularly useful when customer consent is collected through Netmera-managed channels such as websites, apps, or call centers. With this setup, Netmera not only manages consent data internally but also pushes it to IYS, enabling centralized and compliant communication control.
Two Modes of IYS Integration
Mode
Description
IYS Sync Mode
IYS is the master source and Netmera regularly imports consent data
Netmera can
read
and
update
existing user records in IYS but cannot create new users.
IYS Integrator Mode
Netmera manages permissions and updates IYS directly
Netmera can
create
your brand entry under a user’s IYS profile and
push
consent
records
directly to IYS.
💡 Before using the
IYS Integrator Mode
, your organization must grant
Integrator Permission
to Netmera from the IYS portal and activate the checkbox in the IYS Connector settings within the platform.
Getting Started
Step 1: Grant Integrator Permission
You must authorize Netmera as your IYS Integrator in the IYS portal. This allows Netmera to:
Create users in IYS
Update their permission statuses
Sync user records using Netmera as the source
Make sure the setting
Mutabakat Yönetimi
is enabled in your IYS Panel. Without this setting, Netmera cannot  create, update, or sync user permission data in IYS.
Step 2: Enable the
IYS Integrator Mode
In Netmera Panel:
Go to
Settings > Connectors > IYS
Check the box:
IYS Integrator (Netmera will create and manage users)
Save your changes
Step 3: Contact Upload with IYS Integration
You can upload user data via CSV or TXT files under
Targeting > Contact Upload
. When you upload a file containing any of the following identifiers, Netmera will create or update the user profile accordingly:
email
phonenumber
external_id
Netmera uses this identifier to decide whether to create a new user or update an existing one.
Uploaded files are considered the source —
the latest upload overrides existing data.
The uploaded files
must include
IYS-specific fields for every user:
IYSSource
IYSConsentDate
, and
IYSStatus
Field Matching
During upload, you'll be prompted to match columns in your file to profile attributes in Netmera. If column headers match existing attributes (e.g.,
email
external_id
phonenumber
), they’ll be auto-detected.
Required Columns in IYS Integrator Mode
IYSource
: The consent collection channel. Must be one of the following values:
IYSStatus
: Consent status must be either
ONAY
(approved) or
RET
(rejected).
IYSConsentDate
: Consent timestamp in the format
dd.mm.yy hh:mm:ss
email / phonenumber
: You must upload at least one (email or phone number). You may upload both, provided the consent status (
ONAY
RET
) is the same for both channels.
Optional Columns
External ID
: An external ID for the user. If not provided, users will be matched by their email or phone number.
In IYS Sync status, if any required IYS fields are missing, the upload is blocked. If fields are partially filled or contain errors, affected users are created as
optout
Country code is mandatory
in phone number values (e.g., +905XXXXXXXXX)
If email and phone number have different consent statuses, do not upload in the same file.
Adding Profile Attributes
After defining the required identifiers (
email
phonenumber
, or
external_id
) and IYS-specific fields (
IYSSource
IYSStatus
IYSConsentDate
), you may include additional
profile attributes
as extra columns in your upload file.
Before uploading the file, all profile attributes you intend to use must be
pre-configured
in the Netmera Panel under
Developers > Profile Attributes
. If they are not pre-configured, you will receive an error notification in the
result screen
indicating which columns were unmatched or ignored.
Status Selection
During upload, select one of the following statuses:
Subscribed / Unsubscribed
If this status is selected:
IYS fields are
optional
Use when uploading users with fixed consent values (all optin or all optout)
Note:
Users created in this flow
won’t be created in IYS.
IYS Syncronize
Enables consent synchronization between Netmera and IYS. File must include IYS fields.
You must
choose
this option to sync your data to IYS through your uploaded file.
Step 4: Matching Contact Information
After uploading your contact file, you’ll be taken to the Profile Attributes screen. This step ensures that the columns in your file are accurately mapped to Netmera’s profile attributes.
In this screen:
System-required fields like
IYSSource
IYSStatus
, and
IYSConsentDate
will be automatically matched if named correctly.
Additional fields such as
surname
, or
address
will also be listed as profile attributes.
A total count of columns to be imported is shown at the bottom.
What to Do If Any Field Appears Red
If any field appears in
red
, it means the column header does not match any pre-configured profile attribute in Netmera.
To resolve this, click the ✏️
Edit
icon and select the appropriate profile attribute from the dropdown.
Once all mappings are correct, click
Save
to proceed.
If any custom attribute in your file has not been pre-configured in Netmera’s panel (
Developers > Profile Attributes
), it must be created
before
uploading. Otherwise, it will not be imported, and you will receive an error prompt during the upload summary.
Once you upload your files to Netmera, processing times depend on the IYS systems:
New users
: If the user is being created for the first time, the process is typically completed within
30 minutes
Existing users
: If you are updating an existing contact, it may take
2–3 hours
to complete.
Case Scenarios
Case 1: Same Email/SMS Permissions
Upload includes both
email
and
phonenumber
columns with identical IYS values. Consent status is applied uniformly.
Both email and SMS have identical consent values.
Status
applies
both
channels
If email and phone number (SMS) have different consent statuses, do not upload in the same file.

Best Practices
Use consistent and accurate formatting for date fields and phone number (SMS).
If uploading mixed-consent users,
split them into separate files
When using the
IYS Integrator Mode
, ensure your integration permission with IYS is active and that required fields are present.
