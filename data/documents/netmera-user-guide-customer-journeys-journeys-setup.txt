Choose a Conversion Event
What is a Conversion and Conversion Event?
A "
Conversion
" refers to the successful completion of a specific, predefined action by a user, which is valuable to the business. A "
Conversion Event
" is the specific action or series of actions that a user must take in order to be counted as a conversion. It is a predefined metric set by the business or marketing team. For example:
Making a purchase
Applying for a credit card
Updating profile information
Conversions are crucial metrics for measuring the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and overall business performance, as they often directly correlate with revenue generation or lead acquisition.
Choose Conversion Event:
In this section, you must select an event that signifies the success of the journey. This metric is crucial for evaluating the journey's effectiveness. Use the dropdown menu provided to select a conversion event that aligns with your journey's goals. An example might be selecting "Purchase" to indicate successful transactions as the journey's target outcome.
Events Information:
To select a conversion event in this journey, the event must first be created under
Developers > Events
. If the event is not set up there, it won't be available for selection here. For detailed instructions on how to create a new event, please refer to
Events
Set a Conversion Event Before Starting the Journey:
A conversion event must be defined before launching the journey. Once the journey begins, it is not possible to add or modify the conversion event. Ensure this step is completed to accurately track and measure the success of your campaign.
Add Trigger Filters:
If you wish to track specific attributes of the chosen conversion event, check the
Add Trigger Filters
box. This option reveals additional configuration settings, allowing you to define and link specific properties using
and logic
to refine the conditions under which the event is tracked. For instance, you might track events where the "Product Category" is "Electronics" and the "Purchase Amount" exceeds $100. These filters help to enhance targeting precision and ensure that only significant events are monitored.
Event Properties Information:
To access event properties, you must define these properties when creating the event under
Developers > Events
. If properties are not provided during event creation, they will not be available for selection later.
Once all necessary fields and optional settings are completed, proceed by clicking the
button located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This action takes you to the next phase of journey setup, where you can define entry rules, set up your target audience, and customize the journey flow.
