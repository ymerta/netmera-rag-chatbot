IYS Permission Hub
One interface. Two powerful paths to IYS compliance.
In Turkey, regulations require brands to manage user communication permissions through IYS. For many businesses, this creates a delicate balance between
reducing
legal
risk
and
keeping
operations
efficient
The IYS Permission Hub in Netmera solves this challenge by giving you complete control over how consent data flows. You decide whether permissions are managed primarily in IYS and reflected in Netmera, or managed in Netmera and sent to IYS, based on your processes, data sources, and compliance strategy.
Two Modes. Built for Different Needs.
IYS Sync Mode
Netmera ensures every update is accurately reflected in both systems.

Sends updates from Netmera to IYS for existing users
