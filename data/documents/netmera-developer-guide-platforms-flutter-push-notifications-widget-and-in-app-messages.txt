Pop-up and In-App Message Presentation Behavior
All push notifications in Netmera work automaticallyâ€”no additional coding is required. However, you can customize pop-up presentations and listen to push callbacks.
By default, when a popup notification or in-app message is received:
immediately
when the app returns to the foreground.
Receiving Popups and In-App Messages in the Background
To receive popups or in-app messages when the application is in the background, you need to enable
Remote Notifications
under
Background Modes
Capabilities
Pop-up Presentation Logic
Enable Pop-up Presentations
To enable pop-up presentation, you need to call the
enablePopupPresentation()
method on the page where you want to display the pop-up.
Netmera.enablePopupPresentation();
To show pop-up on the app start or everywhere in the app, please add this to
initState()
method on your
main.dart
file.
