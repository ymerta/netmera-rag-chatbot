Journey Components
Action
Engage Users at Critical Points in Their Journey
Action components enable you to execute various tasks such as sending emails, push notifications, or in-app messages, thereby engaging users at critical points in their journey. By leveraging action components, you can automate personalized communication, ensuring timely and relevant interactions that enhance user engagement and conversion rates. These actions can be tailored based on user behavior and preferences, allowing for a more dynamic and responsive marketing strategy.
Update Profile
The "Update Profile" component in Netmera's journey setup allows you to
dynamically modify user profile attributes
based on interactions and behaviors. This component is vital for maintaining accurate user data, enhancing personalization in future communications, and optimizing marketing strategies.
Should I use Fire Event or Update Profile?
Update Profile component modifies user profile attributes, ensuring that user data, like "Most Recent Conversion Date" or "User Status," is current and reflective of their actions. On the other hand, Fire Event component triggers specific events based on user interactions within the journey, such as viewing a product or completing a purchase, allowing you to track user behavior in real-time and initiate follow-up actions.
While the Fire Event component focuses on capturing and responding to user interactions for analysis, the Update Profile component is dedicated to managing and updating user data to personalize future communications effectively.
Step Properties
Step Name
This serves as an internal label for the update profile step within the journey. It helps you identify and manage different steps effectively. For instance, you might name it "User Conversion."
Select Attribute
This dropdown allows you to choose
specific user profile attributes
to update, such as "Most Recent Conversion Date," "User Status," or "Last Login Date." This ensures that the correct attribute is modified based on user journey actions.
Action
The "Action" dropdown specifies the
type of operation
to perform on the selected attribute. The available actions include:
Update
: Modify the existing attribute value.
Delete
: Remove the attribute from the user's profile.
Value Types
This dropdown determines the nature of
the value assigned to the attribute.
You can select from:
Constant
: A static value specified by you.
Variable
: A dynamic value sourced from the journey (e.g., a journey variable or profile attribute).
Value
This is where you enter the specific value for the attribute. If "Variable" is selected, this field allows you to select a journey variable or profile attribute. For constant values, you can directly enter the desired value.
By utilizing the "Update Profile" component, you can keep user profiles current and accurate, which is crucial for delivering personalized experiences. This dynamic updating of user attributes allows for more responsive and relevant marketing efforts, ultimately enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
Send Mobile Push
The "Send Push Notification" action in Netmera allows you to
send targeted, real-time notifications
directly to mobile devices. Push notifications are an essential tool for engaging users, improving retention, and encouraging interactions by delivering relevant information. This component supports personalization, dynamic content, deep linking, and multimedia assets to enhance user experience and drive conversions.
Each push notification contains several key elements that determine how it appears on users' devices and how they interact with it.
Push Name
The internal identifier for your push notification. This helps you manage and track different push steps within your journey or campaign. The Push Name does not appear to the user but is crucial for your workflow organization.
Example
: "Welcome Push with Exclusive Offers."
Push Title
The headline or main title of the push notification that appears on the user's device. A well-crafted title grabs attention and sets the context for the message.
Example
: "Exclusive Offer Just for You!" or "New Arrivals Await!"
Push Message
The body of the notification where the key message is delivered. This space should be concise but informative, clearly communicating the call-to-action (CTA) or the benefit to the user.
Example
: "Unlock your 20% discount on your next purchase! Click here to explore the latest arrivals."
A short, engaging message can drive higher open rates and engagement.
Personalization Options
Personalization significantly increases the relevance of the push notification by tailoring it to each individual user. This can be done using dynamic variables that pull data from the user's profile or their journey interactions.
Personalized Title
: Use dynamic attributes to customize the title for each user.
Example
"Welcome back, @{user.name}! Your offer is waiting at @{journey.BrandName}."
Personalized Message
: Similarly, the message body can include dynamic fields to make the content more relatable to the recipient.
Example
: "Hi @{user.name}, don't miss out on your exclusive @{journey.BrandName} offer! Visit now and claim it today!"
Profile Attributes:
Utilize your users' profile attributes, such as past interactions or demographic information, to tailor your messaging. These attributes can help personalize notifications, making them more relevant to each individual user, enhancing engagement. You may check
Profile Attributes
guide for further information.
Journey Variables:
To use Journey Variables in your push notifications, select the Journey Variable in
Step 2: Entry Rules >
Action-based Entry Rules
> Add Trigger Filters > Journey Variable
. This allows you to personalize messages based on the user’s actions. For example, if a customer adds a specific brand to their cart, the
@{journey.BrandName}
will automatically update in the message. Instead of a generic message like "Check out your cart," you can send "Check out the amazing deals on @{journey.BrandName} in your cart!" making the notification more relevant.
By integrating variables such as user name, location, or recent activity (e.g., abandoned cart), personalization fosters a deeper connection with the recipient, leading to better response rates.
Advanced Push Notification Settings
To further refine the notification’s behavior and impact, you can configure several additional options:
Push Click Action
Defines the action that occurs when the user interacts with the notification (clicks or taps on it).
Nothing
: The notification is displayed, but clicking on it does not trigger any further action.
Open App
: Opens the app when the notification is tapped, landing the user on the default screen.
Go to Deeplink
: Directs the user to a specific location within the app or to an external URL through a deeplink.
Example Deeplink
: "app://home?category=@{user.favoriteCategory}"
Deeplinks are particularly useful for guiding users to personalized content, such as a product page, promotional offer, or a previously abandoned cart.
Deeplink Type
Select whether the deeplink leads to an internal app destination or an external web URL. The deep linking type should align with your campaign objectives, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Additional Parameters
You can append extra data or parameters to the deeplink or URL to further customize the user’s navigation experience. These additional parameters may include specific attributes, such as a product ID, category name, or other personalized data relevant to the campaign.
Example
: "www.yourshop.com/cart?item=@{user.lastViewedItem}"
Rich Media
Enhance your notification by embedding rich media, making it visually more appealing and interactive. Visual elements can boost engagement and make your message stand out among other notifications.
Android/iOS-Specific Media
: You can customize the media content based on the user's platform (Android/iOS), ensuring compatibility and optimizing the user experience.
Example
: Add a promotional banner image: "https://example.com/media/banner-offer.jpg"
Including visual elements like product images or promotional banners can improve user click-through rates.
