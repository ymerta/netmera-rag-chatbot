A/B Testing
To maximize impact, Netmera enables you to test multiple versions of a notification on a small user group before sending it to your entire audience. After measuring performance (clicks, conversions, etc.), the system selects the most effective version and delivers it to the remaining users. This helps you refine messaging strategies based on actual user behavior.
Use A/B Testing to:
Compare message titles, visuals, or call-to-actions
Identify what drives better engagement or conversions
Eliminate guesswork from campaign content decisions
