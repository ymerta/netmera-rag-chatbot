Step 1: User Import
The first step in the SMS onboarding process is to import your user list into the Netmera platform. This allows you to have a database of recipients to whom you can send your SMS messages. Make sure to have your user list ready in a compatible format, and follow the instructions provided by Netmera to import the list successfully.
To import your Contacts or Email List into Netmera, follow these steps:
Targeting -> File Transfer -> User Upload
Go to the Targeting section in the Netmera dashboard. Select "File Transfer" from the menu. Click on "User Upload".
Enter a name for the file in the "File Name" field. This name will be used to identify the file in the File Transfers screen.
Click on the "Choose File" button to select the text file that contains the user information. Text file must contain single user information on each line. Ex: token, externalId.
Once you have selected the file, click on the "Create User List" button to start the import process.

Step 2: SMS Provider Details
Before setting up the SMS channel, we need to gather the necessary details from you regarding the SMS provider you are using. This includes information such as API keys, usernames, passwords, or other credentials required to establish a connection with the provider. Collect these details from your provider and keep them handy for the setup process.

Step 3: Setting Up SMS Channel
In this step, we will configure the SMS channel within the Netmera platform. If you are working with an existing provider, we use the gathered information from Step 2 to set up the necessary credentials and parameters for you.
Netmera provides connectors for various SMS providers, making the setup process streamlined and efficient. If you are working with a provider that is not already integrated, reach out to the Netmera product team for analysis and further instructions.
Below you will see examples of Apikey and Form for different providers. The context changes according to the provider.
