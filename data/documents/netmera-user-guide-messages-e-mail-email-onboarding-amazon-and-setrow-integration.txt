At Netmera, we prioritize a seamless integration experience when connecting with third-party email platforms like Amazon SES, Setrow, or Uzman Posta. Our goal is to guide you through each step of the process to ensure successful setup and optimal campaign performance.
1. Account Activation & Setup
Provide Information: Share your company details and specific email requirements.
Contact Establishment: Netmera will initiate communication with your selected email platform.
Provider Collaboration: We coordinate with Amazon, Setrow, or Uzman Posta to ensure your account is configured correctly.
Account Activation: Once verified, your account will be activated for use.
2. DNS Configuration
Proper DNS setup is essential for successful email delivery.
Amazon SES: Netmera handles DNS configuration to ensure a streamlined setup.
Setrow: The provider performs its own DNS checks and completes the process by whitelisting your domain.
Uzman Posta: DNS settings must be obtained from the provider and added as instructed.
Ensure all DNS records are correctly configured to maintain high deliverability and proper sender authentication (e.g., SPF, DKIM, and DMARC).
3. Integration with Netmera

Netmera Panel > Connectors > Email > Install
Configuration:
After clicking Install, you'll be redirected to the integration setup page. Enter the details provided by your email platform.
API Key Requirement:
Your Netmera API Key is required to complete the integration. You can find it under:

4. Platform-Specific Guidance
Each platform may require unique settings or credentials. Ensure you collect and enter the following where applicable:
Amazon SES: Access key, secret key, region, verified domain, etc.

Setrow: API credentials and domain verification details.

Uzman Posta: SMTP settings or API key, based on integration type.

5. IYS (Permission Management System) Management
Netmera supports flexible IYS management options:
Internal Management: If you prefer to manage IYS within Netmera, you can configure your IYS Code and Brand Code under the Integration section.
External Management: Alternatively, if IYS is managed externally, weâ€™ll coordinate accordingly.
Proper IYS integration ensures compliance with Turkish email marketing regulations and improves message deliverability.
