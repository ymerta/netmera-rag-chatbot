User & Attributes
Managing User Data
The
NetmeraUser
class allows you to send structured information about your application's users to Netmera. The ideal time to update user attributes is
right after the user logs into your application.
User ID Management
For optimal performance and data integrity:
Update user information at login
: Itâ€™s crucial to update the user information as soon as the user logs in.
Unique userId
: Ensure that each user has a unique
userId
. Assigning the same
userId
to multiple users leads to data inconsistencies and is not recommended.
Updating User Information
After login, create a
NetmeraUser
object, set the attributes, and call
UpdateUser
NetmeraUser user = new NetmeraUser();
user.SetUserId("your_xid");
user.SetBirthday("1991", "06", "30");
user.SetCity("Istanbul");
// Update the user profile in Netmera
NetmeraCore.Instance.UpdateUser(user.JsonNode);
