Push Notification Permissions
If you don't request notification permission at runtime, you can request it by calling the
requestPushNotificationAuthorization()
method. Note: Notification runtime permissions are required on Android 13 (API 33) or higher. Therefore, before calling the method, make sure your project targets an API of 33 and above.
Netmera.requestPushNotificationAuthorization();
You can call the
areNotificationsEnabled()
method if you need to know the status of permissions.
await Netmera.areNotificationsEnabled() // Use the enabled status of permission as boolean
The usage details of the
areNotificationsEnabled
and
requestPushNotificationAuthorization
methods have been added to the Readme file.
