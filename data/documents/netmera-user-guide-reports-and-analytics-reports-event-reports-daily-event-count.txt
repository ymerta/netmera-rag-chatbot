Events are a fundamental aspect of data analytics for platforms and applications. They represent specific user interactions or occurrences within your platform or app that are essential for understanding user behavior, tracking engagement, and making informed decisions. The "Daily Events (Count)" page is a powerful tool that allows you to closely examine these events and their attributes over time, providing valuable insights into user interactions.
The "Daily Events (Count)" page is designed to help you track and analyze events within your platform or application on a daily basis. Here's a breakdown of its key components:
First and Second Event
1.First Event: You can specify the first event that you want to track and count. This event represents a particular user interaction or action within your platform. For instance, it could be a user signing up, making a purchase, or completing a specific task.
2.Platform: You have the option to choose the platform or application on which you wish to track the selected event. This allows you to gather data specific to a particular platform if your product is available on multiple platforms.
3.Second Event (Optional): You can optionally track a second event. This event could be different from the first and provides a more comprehensive view of user interactions. Tracking multiple events can reveal valuable patterns and correlations.
4.Last x days: Specify the timeframe for which you want to count these events. You can choose the number of days, and the system will calculate the event counts for each day within this duration. This enables you to analyze how event frequencies change over time.
5.Second Event Attribute (Optional): If you choose to track a second event, you can further refine the data by selecting a specific attribute associated with this event. Attributes provide additional context or categorization for the event, helping you gain deeper insights.
Event Attributes
Event attributes are specific characteristics or details associated with an event. They provide additional context or data points that can help analyze user behavior more precisely. Event attributes can be selected for both "First Event" and the "Second Event."
Available Event Attributes
Event attributes in Netmera are specific characteristics or details associated with an event, providing additional context or data points for more precise user behavior analysis. The available event attributes can vary based on the event type.
