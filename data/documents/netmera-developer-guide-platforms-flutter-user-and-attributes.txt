User & Attributes
Managing User Data
The
NetmeraUser
class allows you to send structured information about your application's users to Netmera. The ideal time to update user attributes is
right after the user logs into your application.
User ID Management
For optimal performance and data integrity:
Update user information at login
: Itâ€™s crucial to update the user information as soon as the user logs in.
Unique userId
: Ensure that each user has a unique
userId
. Assigning the same
userId
to multiple users leads to data inconsistencies and is not recommended.
Updating User Information
After login, create a
NetmeraUser
object, set the attributes, and call
updateUser
updateUser
() {
NetmeraUser
user
new
NetmeraUser
();
user.
setUserId
(userController.text);
user.
setName
(nameController.text);
user.
setSurname
(surnameController.text);
user.
setEmail
(emailController.text);
user.
setMsisdn
(msisdnController.text);
user.
setGender
int
parse
(_selectedGender));
// Update the user profile in Netmera
Netmera
updateUser
(user);
Important:
userId
cannot
be removed.
You should send a
single
user update request at a time.

Creating Custom Profile Attributes
Step 1: Navigate to the Developers section
Custom profile attributes must be created and configured in the Netmera Panel before they can be used in the application.
Go to
Panel
Developers > Profile Attributes > Create New Attribute.
Step 2: Fill in Attribute Details
Define the following information:
Name
: The unique identifier for the attribute.
Label
: A user-friendly name for the attribute.
Description
: A brief description of the attribute.
Data Type
: Choose the appropriate data type for the attribute.
Is Array
: Define whether the attribute can hold multiple values.
Step 3: Save the Attribute
After clicking
Save
, the custom attribute will be available for assignment to your users.
Step 4: Generated Code for Custom Attributes
Once the attribute is defined in the Netmera Panel, the generated code can be found at the bottom of the
Profile Attribute
page, under the
Generate Code
section. This code must be added to your Netmera Panel under
Profile Attributes > User Class
Private Information Considerations
Under the
law, the sharing of private user data is prohibited. To ensure compliance:
Private Information Flag
: When defining profile attributes or events, the
Private Information
Private Information
flag during the
(Netmera.update(user))
call. If the flag is set, the request will not be sent to the backend.
