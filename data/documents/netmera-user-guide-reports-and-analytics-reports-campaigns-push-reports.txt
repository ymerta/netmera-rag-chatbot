Data-Driven Push Insights for Better Engagement and Performance
The Push Notification Summary and Metrics document provides a comprehensive overview of how to analyze and optimize push notification campaigns. By tracking key data points such as user engagement, message performance, and conversion metrics, marketers can better understand the effectiveness of their campaigns and make data-driven decisions to improve user interaction and achieve campaign goals.
Push Notification Summary
The
Message Report Dashboard
provides detailed insights into the performance of push notification campaigns, helping to track user engagement, message effectiveness, and overall campaign success.
1. Campaign Name & Message ID
Name
: This is the title given to a push notification campaign. It helps in quickly identifying and referencing a specific campaign within the system.
Message ID
: A unique identifier assigned to each push notification message. This helps in tracking and managing messages in the system.
2. Message Type
This indicates the type of message being delivered to the users. The type of message helps determine the method of delivery and the medium through which users will interact.
3. Message Text
The actual content of the push notification or message sent to the users. It includes the key message or call-to-action, such as "Your latest transaction is ready for review.
Method
Creator:
The individual who created and initiated the campaign or message. This is useful for accountability and understanding who to reach out to if there are any questions or issues related to the campaign.
Selection Criteria / Broadcasting:
If the message was
broadcasted
, it means it was sent to all your users without using segmentation or tagging.
Selection Criteria / Segments & Tags:
Alternatively, the message might be sent to a specific
segments or tags
based on user behavior, demographics, or preferences. Then it will show you a summary of the segments or tags you used.
Campaign Status
Finished
: Indicates that the campaign has ended, and no further messages will be sent.
Sending
: Indicates that the campaign is ongoing and messages are still being sent.
Timing
Create
: The date and time the message was created in the system. This helps in understanding when the campaign was initiated and allows you to correlate timing with user engagement.
Start
: The time when the push notification was sent out to users. If the campaign has a scheduled send time, this will indicate when the message was actually delivered to the users' devices.
End
: The time the campaign or message ended, whether it is the conclusion of the message's send period or the end of a specific promotional or informational window.
This dashboard highlights key details like message content, delivery method, timing, and the creator. It also includes information on the selection criteria, campaign status, and timing, enabling marketers to analyze and optimize push notifications based on user interaction and engagement.
Push Notification Metrics
Target Audience
The
Target Audience
metric represents the total number of devices or users that you aim to reach with a push notification. This is the
intended scope
of your campaign. It reflects your campaign's reach, showing the number of devices you plan to engage with your message.
Example
: If your campaign is designed to reach 1000 users, the "Target Audience" is 1000. It doesn't mean that the notifications have been sent yet; it just sets the goal for the reach.
Users
The
Users
metric refers to the
actual number of individual users
who received the push notification. This indicates how effective the push notification delivery was in terms of reaching the intended audience.
Example
: If 800 out of the 1000 intended users received the notification, the "Users" count will be 800. This is the number of unique individuals who actually received the push notification.
Difference Between Target Audience and Users:
While
Target Audience
shows the number of users you planned to reach,
Users
reflects how many of those people actually received the push notification.
: The
Target Audience
is the
goal
intended
reach, and
Users
shows the actual number of users who received the message. If you experience issues with delivery or targeting, the "Users" count might fall short of your "Target Audience."
Sent
The
Sent
metric indicates the
total number of push notifications dispatched
to the target audience. It shows how many messages were sent out as part of the campaign, whether they were successfully delivered or not.
Example
: If your campaign is designed to reach 1200 people, but you actually sent 1000 notifications (perhaps due to some retry mechanism or delivery issues), the "Sent" count would be 1000. This metric helps assess how many notifications were placed into the delivery pipeline.
Success
Success
refers to the
successful delivery
of push notifications to users or devices. This metric reveals how many of the intended push notifications actually reached the recipients.
Example
: If you sent 1200 notifications but only 1000 were successfully delivered due to delivery issues (e.g., network problems or invalid device tokens), then the "Success" count would be 1000. It represents the actual outcome of your distribution process.
Clicked
The
Clicked
metric shows the
percentage
of users who interacted with the push notification by clicking on it. This metric indicates how engaging the push notification was to the users.
Example
: If 1000 users received the notification and 200 users clicked on it, the "Clicked" percentage would be 20%. This is crucial for understanding how compelling and relevant the notification is to the users.
Avg. Time In App
Average Time In App
refers to the
average duration
users spend in the app after they click on the push notification. This metric provides insights into the
level of user engagement
and the impact the notification has on driving users to interact with the app more.
Example
: If users, on average, stay in the app for 10 minutes after clicking on the push notification, this reflects the effectiveness of your push notification in increasing user engagement.
Hot Conversion
Hot Conversion
refers to the number of users who took a
conversion action
after clicking the push notification. A conversion action could be a purchase, sign-up, or any other predefined goal.
Example
: If you set up a conversion event like a "purchase" after clicking a notification, the "Hot Conversion" metric shows how many users went ahead and made a purchase. To view this data, you must first define a conversion event under the
Conversion Analytics
section in your campaign setup.
Hot Revenue
Hot Revenue
represents the
monetary value
generated by users who completed a conversion action after interacting with the push notification. This metric ties the push notification campaign to
financial outcomes
Example
: If a conversion event was a purchase and users who clicked on the notification spent $1000 in total, this amount would be reflected as "Hot Revenue." To view this, you need to have a purchase-related conversion event set up during the campaign creation process.
Push Clicks
The
Push Clicks
metric indicates the
total number of clicks
users made on the push notification, regardless of whether they converted or not. This measure gives a
broad view of interaction
with the notification.
Example
: If your push notification was clicked 500 times by different users, the "Push Clicks" count would be 500. It shows how much interest the notification sparked among users.
Differences: Target Audience, Sent, and Success
Target Audience
is your
initial goal
—the number of people you want to reach.
Sent
is the number of notifications you’ve
actually distributed
to your target audience. It shows the volume of messages that went out, including any retry attempts or added users.
Success
is the number of notifications that were
successfully delivered
to the users. It's the real-world outcome of your campaign's distribution efforts.
Example:
Let’s say:
You want to reach 1000 people (Target Audience).
You sent 800 notifications (Sent).
750 notifications were successfully delivered (Success).
Out of 750 delivered notifications, 200 users clicked the notification (Clicked).
50 users made a purchase after clicking the notification (Hot Conversion).
The total revenue from these purchases was $5000 (Hot Revenue).
In this case,
Target Audience
= 1000,
Sent
= 800,
Success
= 750,
Clicked
= 200,
Hot Conversion
= 50, and
Hot Revenue
= $5000.
This breakdown helps you assess the performance of your push notification campaign at each stage—from initial delivery to actual user interaction and the resulting conversions and revenue.
