Tagless Data Capture
Tagless Tracking for Smarter Data Collection
Netmera Tagless Data Capture automatically detects and collects
screen views
and
user interaction events
—without requiring any manual tagging or custom development effort. It provides a faster, low-code way to collect behavioral data, helping product teams and marketers optimize experiences with real-time insights.
Screen Tracking Dashboard
Path:
Settings > Screen Tracking > Views / Actions
This dashboard is your control center for screen and action mapping.
Sections:
Track Views / Track Actions:
Displays current screen and interaction events that have already been mapped and published.
Unmapped Views / Actions:
Shows user actions detected on your test devices that are not yet linked to defined events. These will need to be manually named and published.
Step 1: Enable Tracking
Path:
Settings > Screen Tracking > Track Views / Track Actions / Collect Values
Turn on Track Views, Track Actions and Collect Values on their respective pages to start collecting data.
What Each Toggle Does
Track Views:
Enables the collection of full-screen transitions such as
Home Page
Product Page
Cart
, etc. This helps you understand which pages users are navigating to.
Track Actions:
Captures user interactions with the interface, such as taps, clicks, or selections on specific elements. Useful for analyzing feature usage and engagement.
Collect Values:
Extends action tracking by capturing the
specific
value
of the item clicked or interacted with.
For example, if a user taps a product titled "Blue Sneakers" at the end of a path like
/category/shoes
, this toggle ensures that
"Blue Sneakers"
is included in the data payload.
This allows you to not only track
which
action was triggered but also
what
the user selected or interacted with.
Step 2: Add Test Devices
Path:
Settings > Test Devices > Invite Tester / Add Tester
To begin collecting screen views and user interaction events, you must first register test devices. These devices are used to
simulate
app usage in a controlled environment so that Netmera can detect and log potential screen and action events for mapping. Refer to
Test Devices
for further information.
Option 1: Inviting Testers via Email
Navigate to the left menu of the panel and select "
Settings
Click on "
Test Devices
" to access the test device management screen.
Locate the "
Invite Tester
" button and click on it.
Enter your email address in the provided field to receive the invitation link.
Check your email for the received invitation link.
On the device you want to add as a test device, click on the invitation link from the email.
The link will redirect you to the mobile application and automatically add the device as a test device.
Option 2: Adding Test Devices with their External ID
In the "
Settings -> Test Devices
" screen, find and click on the "
Add Tester
" button.
Enter your
external ID
in the provided field.
The system will list available devices for you to add as test devices.
Click on the desired device from the list to add it as a test device with a single click.
Option 3: Adding a Tester with User Details
Navigate to the left menu of the panel and select "
Targeting
Click on "
People
" to access the people search screen. Then, click on "
Find Person
Write their
External ID
email
and click "
Find
When you see your user's results, click on "
User ID
" which is shown in color green.
You will see a warning about action loggings saying "You are accessing user private data, your action will be logged." click
Yes.
On top of the page, you will see three options. Click on "
Assign as a Tester
" >
"Get Devices."
You are going to see a list of all the platforms you may use this user as a tester. Select your Platform (sms, email, etc.) and choose
"Add Tester."
If you haven't set an External ID for your user please follow these steps:
updateUser() methods to set xid:
To set xid, you can use the updateUser() method with the userId. For detailed information, refer to our developer documentation with the following links.
iOS User Documentation
Android User Documentation
Precondition:
Set your
iOS URL Schema
and
Android Package Name
under
Developers > App Info
Step 3: Simulate Flows with Test Devices
Once your test device is registered, interact with your application to simulate user flows. Netmera Tagless Data Capture will automatically generate candidate event paths based on your actions—no manual coding required.
Views Example:
"Home"
"Product List"
"Product Detail"
"Cart"
This captures the sequential screen transitions as a user navigates through your app.
Actions Example:
"Tap Search"
"Select Filter"
"Tap Add to Favorites"
These represent individual user interactions with buttons or interactive elements.
Values Example:
"Tap Product: Running Shoes"
"Tap Color Option: Red"
"Tap Size: 42"
The
Collect Values
feature appends contextual details—such as the name, label, or value of the item clicked—at the end of the action path.
These automatically generated candidate paths can later be reviewed, named, and published for consistent tracking across your application.
Step 4: Create and Save Mappings
Navigate to:
Unmapped Views
Unmapped Actions
under the Tagless Data Collection section.
Click “Create New”
to open the mapping editor for the selected view or action.
Assign a Screen Name:
Enter a meaningful and consistent name that reflects the purpose of the screen (e.g.,
ProductDetail
OnboardingStep1
Choose Tracking Option:
Use the
Track
toggle/button to decide whether this mapping should be actively tracked. This allows you to save mappings without enabling them immediately if needed.
Match Android and iOS Paths (Optional but Recommended):
Netmera allows you to group equivalent screen views or actions across platforms into a single mapping. Use the
Add
button in the Mappings table to attach a corresponding path from the other platform (e.g., match the Android
product/detail
screen with the iOS
productDetailsView
). This ensures consistency in reporting and simplifies cross-platform analytics.
Finalize and Save:
Once both platforms (if applicable) are matched, click the green
Add
button to save your mapping.
Publish the Changes:
After saving, return to the
Views / Actions
dashboard and click the
“Publish”
button.
Publishing is required
to activate the mappings—otherwise, they remain in draft and will not be applied.
How to Match Corresponding Mappings Between Android and iOS
To unify event tracking across platforms, Netmera allows you to
combine Android and iOS paths
into a single mapping entry. This helps reduce duplication and makes reports easier to interpret.
Steps to match paths:
In the
Mappings table
of the mapping creation screen, locate the existing path for one platform (e.g., Android).
Find the corresponding path from the other platform listed under Unmapped Views/Actions.
Click the
“Add”
button next to the correct platform entry.
The selected path will be added under the same mapping, allowing you to track Android and iOS screens/actions as one.
Example:
You might have the Android path
/product/detail
and the iOS path
productDetailScreen
. Matching both under a single mapping called
ProductDetail
will allow you to see unified analytics for that screen.
Step 5: Screen your Data with User Path
Path:
Analytics > User Path
User Path Analytics allows you to preview flow efficiency, drop-offs, and repetitive actions using data from your test sessions.
Filter Options:
Segment:
Analyze specific user groups (e.g., VIPs, new users)
Device:
Filter by operating system or device version
Filter:
Choose a specific screen or action
Direction:
See what precedes or follows a selected event
Date Range:
Observe behavior trends over time
