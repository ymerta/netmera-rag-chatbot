Custom Profile Attributes
Custom Profile Attributes allow you to capture and store specific types of customer information that are not covered by standard fields, such as product preferences, behavioral scores, or other domain-specific data points.
Profile Attributes Dashboard
The Profile Attributes dashboard is where you manage and review your user data structure. It organizes attributes into two main types:
Standard Attributes
These are predefined by Netmera and include essential fields such as:
email
msisdn
device identifiers
Standard attributes ensure consistency and interoperability across the platform.
Custom Attributes
You can define attributes tailored to your business, such as:
Lifetime Value
Lead Source
Subscription Type
Custom attributes help you personalize your engagement strategies, enhance segmentation, and improve analytics.
Standard Attributes
Reading the Attribute Table
Each attribute listed in the dashboard includes detailed metadata:
Field
Description

A unique key used in API calls and developer integrations.
Attribute
The display name shown in the panel (e.g., “City”, “Gender”).
Description
A short explanation of the attribute’s purpose.
Is Personal Info
Indicates whether the attribute contains personal or sensitive data.
Calculate Analytics
Specifies if the attribute contributes to analytics and reports.
Unit
Denotes the measurement unit, if applicable (e.g., TL, %, cm).
Calculated
Shows whether the value is dynamically computed based on other data.

Example:
Suppose you are creating a custom profile attribute for tracking the customer's preferred communication channel. Here's an example:
Name
communicationPreference
Label
Communication Preference
Order
(for placement within your list of profile attributes)
Description
Records the customer's preferred communication channel, such as email, SMS, or app notifications.
Data Type
String
(to capture a single preferred communication channel)
In this scenario, the custom profile attribute "communicationPreference" captures the customer's choice of communication channel for receiving notifications or updates.
Step 2: Save and Generate Code
Once your attribute is configured, click
Save
. This action will:
Save the custom attribute to your data model.
