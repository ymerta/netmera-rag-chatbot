Understanding Retention and Cohort Analysis
Retention
Retention is a metric that evaluates how effectively a product or service retains its users over a specified period. It focuses on sustaining user engagement and interest over time by measuring the percentage of users who continue to perform key actions, such as opening an app or interacting with notifications. Higher retention rates typically indicate stronger user satisfaction and ongoing interest in the product or service.
Cohort
Cohort analysis involves grouping users who share common characteristics or behaviors within a defined time frame. It enables businesses to study how different segments of users behave after experiencing specific events, such as app launches or making purchases. By tracking user actions and behaviors over time, cohort analysis provides valuable insights into user retention patterns, conversion rates, and overall engagement effectiveness. This helps you tailor their strategies to better meet the needs and preferences of different user segments.
Start a New Retention Chart
Retention analysis using "Open App" as the event helps businesses understand user behavior and engagement patterns. By tracking how many users return to open the app on subsequent days, you can evaluate the effectiveness of your app's retention strategies. The percentage of users returning to open the app over time provides insights into the app's ability to maintain user interest and ongoing engagement.
This analysis is essential for optimizing app features, user communication strategies, and overall user experience to improve retention rates and ensure sustained user engagement over time.
Date:
This section indicates the specific date or starting point for evaluating user retention. It marks the beginning of the period during which user engagement will be tracked.
Retention Chart Results
The retention chart provides insights into user behavior after their initial app interaction. It's a valuable tool for assessing user retention strategies and understanding how engagement evolves over time.
Day of Open App:
In the table, "Day of Open App" denotes the number of days since users first opened the app.
Users:
The "Users" column shows the count of users who returned to open the app again on each subsequent day. For example, under "Day of Open App +1," it indicates how many users returned to open the app one day after their initial session.
% of Users Open App:
This column displays the percentage of users who returned to open the app again relative to the total number of users who opened the app on the starting date. It helps assess user retention over time by showing how many users continue to engage with the app after their initial interaction.
The retention chart presents a visual representation of user engagement trends following their initial interaction with the app. By analyzing the number of returning users and the corresponding percentages over successive days, businesses can assess the effectiveness of their retention strategies. This analysis helps in optimizing user engagement tactics, improving app usability, and fostering long-term user loyalty.
Start a New Cohort
The Cohort Dashboard in Netmera allows you to analyze user behavior based on two selected events, providing insights into how different actions correlate and impact user engagement and conversion rates.
Event Selection
To begin,
choose two events for analysis.
For example, you can track users who perform a specific action (Second Event), such as making a purchase, after completing another action (First Event), like opening your app.
Choose a Start Date
In the Cohort Dashboard, choose the start date when the first event occurred for the user cohort.
Cohort Results
The Cohort Results table is designed to help you understand user behavior over time, specifically focusing on users who performed Event 1 followed by Event 2. This analysis provides insights into user retention and engagement patterns following the initial event. Remember that you may change these events according to your needs.
Day of Event 1:
This column lists the dates when users performed Event 1. Each date represents a cohort of users who initiated Event 1 on that specific day.
Users (Day +0, +1, +2, etc.):
Each column under the "Users" section indicates the number of users from the initial cohort who performed Event 2 on subsequent days after Event 1. For example:
+0:
The day of Event 1.
+1:
One day after Event 1.
+2:
Two days after Event 1, and so on up to 28 days.
% of Users (Day +0, +1, +2, etc.):
Each column under the "% of Users" section shows the percentage of the initial cohort that returned to perform Event 2 on subsequent days after Event 1. This percentage is calculated relative to the total number of users who performed Event 1 on the initial day.
Export to Excel or Tag Users
The Export to Excel feature enhances operational efficiency by enabling users to export detailed analytics data directly to Excel format. This capability supports:
Detailed Examination:
Exported data includes comprehensive details such as user retention rates, cohort analysis results, and engagement metrics. This depth of information allows for thorough analysis and identification of trends.
Reporting:
Excel exports facilitate the creation of detailed reports and presentations. Users can utilize this data to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders or for internal documentation purposes.
Informed Decision-Making:
Access to raw data in Excel empowers informed decision-making processes. By analyzing exported data, organizations can refine their strategies, optimize customer engagement efforts, and improve overall performance metrics.
