Step 4: When
In the Start Sending Messages section, choose when to send your email campaign:
Now: Send your emails immediately.
Delivery Speed:
Send Fast: Sends the notification to all users at once.
Send in Packages: For large audiences, send notifications in smaller batches. Select the package size, and the system will send notifications batch-by-batch until all users receive them. This can improve delivery efficiency and reduce server load.

Step 5: Go!
Review all your campaign settings and details on the Go! page.
Verify your campaign information carefully.
Test the message on your device to ensure everything looks and works as expected.
When ready, click Send to launch your email campaign.
After sending, monitor your campaign performance via the Reports.
