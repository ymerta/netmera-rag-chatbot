Push Notification Permissions
In Android 13 (API 33) and higher,
runtime notification permissions
are required for push notifications. If you don't request notification permission at runtime, you can use the
requestPushNotificationAuthorization()
method from
Netmera
to request permission from the user.
Important Notes:
Target API 33 or above
: Make sure your Android project is targeting
API 33
or above, as runtime permissions are required starting from Android 13.
User Consent
: Always inform users why you are requesting permission to send notifications, and provide them with the option to grant or deny the permission.
Permission Flow
: You can handle different behaviors based on whether the user has granted or denied the permission.
Step 1: Requesting Notification Permission
To request notification permission, call the
requestPushNotificationAuthorization()
method. Ensure that your project targets
API 33
or higher before using this method. Hereâ€™s how you can request notification permissions:
// Request push notification permission
Netmera
requestPushNotificationAuthorization
();
Step 2: Checking Notification Permission Status
If you need to check whether the user has granted or denied notification permissions, you can use the
areNotificationsEnabled()
method. This returns a
boolean
indicating whether notifications are enabled.
Netmera
areNotificationsEnabled
().
then
((enabled) {
// Use the enabled status of permission as boolean
});
