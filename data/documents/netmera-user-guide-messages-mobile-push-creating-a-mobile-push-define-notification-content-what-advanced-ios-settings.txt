Advanced iOS Settings
These settings help fine-tune how your push notifications are presented and prioritized on iOS devices, ensuring that critical or urgent information reaches users effectively, while less important messages are delivered more passively.

Relevance Score
The Relevance Score is a numerical value ranging from 0 to 1 that determines the importance level of a push notification on iOS devices. Notifications with higher scores appear more prominently in the notification summary, improving visibility and user awareness.

Range: 0.0 – 0.3  
Usage: Low importance

Range: 0.4 – 0.7  
Usage: Medium importance

Range: 0.8 – 1.0  
Usage: High importance

Purpose
This score enables apps to sort notifications based on relevance and ensure that critical messages do not get buried under less urgent ones.
Example Use Case
A suspicious transaction alert may receive a relevance score of 0.95, placing it at the top of the user’s notification stack.
A holiday announcement may receive a score of 0.2, appearing further down in the summary.
Tip: Use higher relevance scores for time-sensitive, security-related, or highly personalized notifications. Lower scores are suitable for informational or promotional messages.
