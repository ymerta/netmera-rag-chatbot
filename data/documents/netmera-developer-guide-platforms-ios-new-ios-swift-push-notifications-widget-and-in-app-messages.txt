Pop-up and In-App Message Presentation Behavior
All push notifications in Netmera work automaticallyâ€”no additional coding is required. However, you can
customize
pop-up presentations and
listen to push callbacks
By default, when a popup notification or in-app message is received:
If the app is in the
foreground
immediately
If the app is in the
background
when the app returns to the foreground.
Enable / Disable Immediate Presentations
To prevent immediate pop-up presentation (e.g., during video playback, gaming, or checkout), use:
Enable popup and widget push
Netmera.
setEnabledPopupPresentation
true
Disable popup and widget push
Netmera.
setEnabledPopupPresentation
false
Enable banner push
Netmera.
setEnabledInAppMessagePresentation
true
Disable banner push
Netmera.
setEnabledInAppMessagePresentation
false
Receiving Popups and In-App Messages in the Background
To receive popups or in-app messages when the application is in the background, you need to enable
Remote Notifications
under
Background Modes
Capabilities
Devices in Low Battery Mode
Devices
cannot
receive popups or in-app messages while the application is closed or killed if the device is in
low battery mode
, as this mode disables background application refresh.
