Deep Linking
Deep Linking
To redirect users to a specific page or view in your app via push notifications with custom action buttons, you can use deep links. Follow these steps to set up deep linking in your app:
Set Up a URL Scheme
In your Xcode project, define a custom URL scheme (
your_deeplink_scheme://
Configure Info.plist
Open your
Info.plist
file.
Add a new key:
URL types
Xcode will create an array with a dictionary called
Item 0
Inside
Item 0
, add:
URL identifier
> Set it to your custom scheme.
URL Schemes
>This creates an array.
Item 0
inside
URL Schemes
> Set it to your custom scheme.
Handle the Deep Link
Implement the following method in your
AppDelegate.swift
to handle deep links:
func
application
app
: UIApplication,
open
url
: URL,
options
Any
Bool
print
"openUrl:
\(url)
return
true
Universal Links
To handle universal links from Netmera push actions (e.g.,
https://your_domain/scheme?query
Set Netmera Push Delegate
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
, add:
Netmera.setPushDelegate(self)
Ensure that your
AppDelegate
conforms to the
NetmeraPushDelegate
protocol.
Implement Universal Link Handlers
Add the following methods to handle universal links:
shouldHandleOpenURL
: Checks if the URL should be handled. Return
true
to process it.
handleOpenURL
: Executes when the URL is triggered by a Netmera push action.
func shouldHandleOpenURL(_ url: URL, for pushObject: NetmeraBasePush) -> Bool {
if url.host == "your_domain" {
return true
return false
func handleOpenURL(_ url: URL, for pushObject: NetmeraBasePush) {
print("openUrl \(url)")
