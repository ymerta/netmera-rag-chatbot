Deep Linking
Step 1: Android & iOS Deep Linking
For comprehensive instructions and code samples, we recommend consulting the native side deep link documentation for both
Android
and
iOS
. This will give you a solid understanding of how to define and manage deep links in your mobile application. By referring to these resources, complete the deep link setup across both platforms.
Step 2: Flutter Deep Linking
Once deep links are configured on the native sides, it's time to integrate deep link handling in your
Flutter
app.
