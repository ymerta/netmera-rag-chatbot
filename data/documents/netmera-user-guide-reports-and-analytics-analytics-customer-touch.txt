Understanding Customer Touch Based on Notifications
The Customer Touch screen categorizes customers according to the number of notifications they receive. This segmentation is visualized through a table where each column represents the count of users who received a specific number of notifications. Here's how to interpret the table:
'Did not receive any' column:
This column indicates the number of users who did not receive any notifications during the specified period. It identifies a segment of customers who may not have engaged with the notification system.
Columns labeled 1, 2, 3, etc.:
These columns display the exact number of users who received that respective number of notifications. For example, the column labeled '1' shows how many users received exactly 1 notification, '2' shows how many received exactly 2 notifications, and so forth.
10+ column:
This column aggregates the total number of users who received more than 10 notifications. It provides a summary of users who are highly engaged and receive a significant number of notifications.
