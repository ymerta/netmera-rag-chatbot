General Settings
In this guide, we will delve into the intricacies of each setting, empowering you to meticulously customize your application's identity, messaging strategy, and functionality. Let's embark on this journey to understand and harness the capabilities of these settings.
General Settings
Application Name
The "Application Name" setting is a crucial identifier for your app within Netmera's ecosystem. This name is used across Netmera's Control Panel and reports, providing a consistent reference point. Opting for a name that resonates with your brand, such as "Netmera," ensures seamless recognition and aligns your app's presence with your brand identity.
Category
The "Category" setting aids in tailoring Netmera's offerings to your specific application type. By selecting the most relevant category, such as "E-Commerce," you enable Netmera to provide default events and segments tailored to your app's nature. This choice streamlines your data analysis and enhances the relevance of Netmera's features to your use case.
Icon
The "Icon" setting adds a visual dimension to your app's representation within Netmera's Control Panel. By uploading an icon, you create a distinctive visual marker that simplifies the process of identifying and selecting your application. This enhancement offers a seamless user experience and contributes to efficient navigation within the Control Panel.

Limit Notifications
The "Limit Notifications" setting empowers you to strike a balance between user engagement and user experience. By setting a maximum limit for push notifications, you ensure that users are not overwhelmed with excessive messages, which could potentially lead to frustration and app uninstalls. This feature safeguards user satisfaction while maintaining effective communication.
Tip:
Push notification limit for application users. Too many notifications may disturb users and cause app uninstalls. To ignore this limit for a notification, use
"Ignore User Message Limits"
setting on campaign form.
Default Message Time Restriction
With the "Default Message Time Restriction" setting, you gain the capability to exert control over the timing of push notifications. This functionality is invaluable for adhering to corporate policies or optimizing user engagement during specific timeframes. By sending notifications only within specified hours, you enhance the relevance of your messages and respect users' preferences.
SMS Cost Per Message
The "SMS Cost Per Message" setting facilitates a clear understanding of messaging costs within the context of your communication strategy. By defining the cost of a single SMS message, you enable precise cost comparisons between push notifications and SMS messaging. This knowledge empowers you to make informed decisions about cost-effective communication channels.
Use Push Inbox
The "Use Push Inbox" setting caters to applications featuring a "Message Inbox" screen. Selecting this option enhances your ability to manage push notifications efficiently using Netmera's dedicated functionalities. This feature enriches user engagement by providing users with a centralized location to access and interact with notifications.
UTM Parameter
The "UTM Parameter" feature enhances campaign tracking for Web push notifications. By specifying UTM Source, Medium, and ID, you optimize the attribution of campaign performance. This feature facilitates the collection of valuable insights, enabling you to measure the effectiveness of your campaigns accurately.
Example:
UTM Source:Netmera, UTM Medium:Campaign Title, UTM ID:Campaign Name.
iOS Badge Handling
The "iOS Badge Handling" setting offers flexibility in managing badges on iOS devices. You have the choice between "App manages badges" and "Netmera manages badges." Opting for the latter empowers you to send push notifications with badges directly from the campaign screen, streamlining the badge management process.
Rest Bulk Notification Approval
The "Rest Bulk Notification Approval" feature simplifies the management of bulk push notifications through REST API. When activated, this mechanism ensures that bulk notifications undergo the approval process, aligning with your organization's approval workflows. This enhancement streamlines communication management while maintaining control.

This customization ensures a secure and tailored login experience.
Style Settings
The "Style Settings" cater to your app's visual identity by enabling font customization. Specify the font name to be used in Netmera's Widget Panel, and take it a step further by uploading a custom font for widgets.

The "Multi Language" setting introduces the power of multi-language campaign sending. Tailor your messaging strategy based on user device language or specific profile attributes. This level of personalization ensures that users receive messages in their preferred language, enhancing engagement and user satisfaction.
Language Settings
With the "Language Settings" feature, you can customize language preferences to match your audience's diversity. Choose between "Device Language" or a "Custom Profile Attribute" to store language information. This customization guarantees that your communication resonates with users across different linguistic backgrounds.

Uninstall Tracking
The "Uninstall Tracking" feature empowers you to manage uninstall tracking efficiently through silent push notifications. Set the time for sending these notifications and even test their effectiveness using the "Send Test Push" function. This enhancement allows you to maintain insights into user behavior even after app uninstalls.
Test/Silent Push:
Silent Push refers to a type of push notification that is sent to a user's device without displaying a visible message or alert to the user. Unlike traditional push notifications that show a message on the device's screen, silent push notifications operate in the background, allowing for the execution of specific tasks or updates without directly engaging the user. This method is particularly useful for scenarios where user interaction is not necessary, such as
updating content, syncing data, or triggering background processes.
These notifications can be configured and tested through both the Netmera API and the Netmera Panel, providing flexibility and comprehensive testing capabilities.
Enable Uninstall Tracking
Check this option to activate silent push sending for uninstall tracking.
Schedule Time
Set the time for sending silent push notifications.
Test Targeting
This feature is used for the "Send Test Push" function, where a test silent push will be sent to the specified tag.
Why is my Uninstall Data Increasing on Android Devices?
At Netmera, we receive device token information for your apps through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Tokens from devices that haven't connected to FCM for over 270 days become invalid. These tokens are linked to passive devices, which have likely been inactive for a long time. Messages sent to these old tokens won't be delivered.
Reasons for inactive tokens:
Devices lost, destroyed, or forgotten
Long periods of inactivity
If a token is inactive for 270 days, FCM marks it as invalid. Once a device reconnects, it gets a new token, and Netmera assigns a new installation ID. This process can lead to higher uninstall numbers, as previously successful message deliveries to these old tokens are now counted as failures. However, this change specifically impacts
Android
devices inactive for 270+ days.
