Creating a Mobile Push
Define the Audience: Who
Step 3: Who
In the
Who
step, the target audience for your push notification is determined. The push notification can be sent to
all users
or your target audience can be narrowed by selecting the users by
"Select Users", "Advanced", and "Distribution List"
which are explained in
Defining Target Audience
After you have chosen your target audience,
Selection Criteria
will show you who you are broadcasting to,
number of users, number of devices, and number of Android/iOS
the notification will be delivered.
Step 3: Who
Ignore User Message Limits
It is an option that allows sending push notifications to users who have exceeded their message limits. Normally, push notification providers set limits on the number of push notifications that can be sent to a user within a certain period of time to prevent spamming or overwhelming the user.
However, in some cases, it may be necessary to send a message to a user even if they have exceeded their limit, such as for urgent notifications or time-sensitive information. In these cases, the "Ignore User Message Limits" option can be used to bypass the limit and ensure that the message is delivered.
It's important to use this option judiciously, as sending too many notifications to a user can lead to annoyance and increased opt-out rates.
Example:
If there is a severe weather condition that could potentially put users in danger, it may be necessary to send a notification to all users, regardless of their message limit preferences. In this case, ignoring user message limits would ensure that the notification reaches all users in a timely manner.
Limit Target Users
When you select "Limit Target Users" option in a campaign, you can specify the maximum number of users who will receive that campaign. This is useful when you want to control the campaign reach and ensure that it doesn't go beyond a certain limit. Once the maximum number of users is reached, the campaign will stop being sent to any additional users, even if they meet the campaign's targeting criteria.
For example, if you are sending a promotional message about a limited-time offer, you may want to limit the number of users who receive the message to ensure that you do not exceed your inventory or capacity. Similarly, if you are testing a new messaging strategy or campaign, you may want to limit the number of users who receive the message to a small sample size before rolling it out to your entire audience.
Defining Target Audience
Target Audience
Example:
If you want to send a personalized email campaign to your customers who have abandoned their carts without making a purchase, you can use the
filter
options to create a target audience by selecting users who have added items to their cart but have not completed the checkout process.
By filtering your users with criteria, you can send a
personalized push
that includes a reminder of the items in their cart, along with related product recommendations and special discounts to encourage them to complete their purchase. This can help reduce cart abandonment rates and drive sales for your business.
Select Users
Advanced
You may select your target users by filtering them with criteria of tags, segments, profiles you have created before or according to their responses to your previous notifications, locations, devices and more.
Criteria mentioned below can be created or edited in "Targeting".
Tag
You can segment your users based on tags that you have created in the 'Targeting > Tags' section. Once you have added at least two tags, you can modify your tag preference using 'And/Or' logical operators. This allows you to refine your targeting and reach specific groups of users who share certain characteristics or behaviors.
Segment
Segments are groups of users that are dynamically structured. Based on the actions they take on the app, users can either enter or exit these segments. To learn more, please refer to the
Define Segment
section.
Profile
The users whoâ€™s specified profile attribute is equal to specified value. This refers to a targeting option where you can select users whose specific profile attribute matches a particular value. For example, you can select users whose "gender" attribute is equal to "female" or users whose "age" attribute is equal to "25".
Response
With this targeting option, you can refine your push notification targeting by selecting users who have or have not interacted with a previously sent push notification. This allows you to tailor your messaging and improve engagement rates by sending notifications to users who are more likely to respond.
Location
This targeting option allows you to target users based on their location. You can specify a geographical region, such as a city, state, or country, and send push notifications to users who are located in that area. This is especially useful for businesses that want to promote events or offers in specific locations.
Last Used Device
This targeting option allows you to target users based on their last used device or other than their last used device. You can choose to send push notifications to users who have recently used a specific device or exclude users who have used a particular device.
Location Preferences
This targeting option allows you to target users based on their location permissions. You can send push notifications to users who have granted location access to your app or exclude users who have denied location access.
Device
This targeting option allows you to target users based on their device type. You can send push notifications to users who are using a specific device, such as an iPhone or an Android phone.
Operator
This targeting option allows you to target users based on their telecom operator. You can send push notifications to users who are using a specific telecom operator.
App Version
This targeting option allows you to target users based on the version of your app that they have installed. You can send push notifications to users who are using a specific version of your app or exclude users who have an outdated version.
Operating System
This targeting option allows you to target users based on the operating system of their device. You can send push notifications to users who are using a specific operating system, such as iOS or Android.
Installation Source
This targeting option is available thanks to Netmera integration with Adjust. It allows you to track users who have installed your app from advertising campaigns and send push notifications to them based on the campaign that brought them to your app.
By App Tracking (Android Only)
This allows you to track and target users based on their in-app behaviors, such as their usage frequency or the actions they take within the app. This can help you to refine your targeting and send push notifications to users who are more likely to engage with your app. Note that this feature is only available on Android devices.
By App Installation
It enables you to target users based on their app installation status. This feature allows you to create personalized communication strategies for different user groups. You can engage new users with onboarding messages and welcome offers, target active users with relevant content and updates, re-engage inactive users with reminders and incentives, and encourage non-users to download the app with promotional campaigns.
Android Provider
This targeting option allows you to target users based on their Android provider. You can send push notifications to users who are using a specific Android provider, such as Google or Huawei.
Promotion
This targeting option allows you to target users based on whether they have a promotion code or not. You can send push notifications to users who have a promotion code to encourage them to use it and drive more sales.
New filters can be defined using conditions and groups by selecting
Advanced
option.
The advanced filter options allow you to create specific target audiences for your promotional email campaigns. By adding conditions and groups, you can tailor your email promotions to customers who have shown an interest in your brand by either purchasing a specific product, subscribing to your newsletter, or browsing your website. Using the "AND" option ensures that only customers who meet all the conditions are included in your target audience, while the "OR" option includes a broader audience of customers who meet any of the conditions. This makes your email promotions more relevant and effective in driving sales for your business.
