Push Callbacks
Netmera provides the following push notification callbacks:
Push Register
: Triggered when a device registers for push notifications.
Push Receive
: Triggered when a push notification is received.
Push Open
: Triggered when a user taps the notification.
Push Dismiss
: Triggered when a user dismisses the notification.
Push Button Click
: Triggered when a user interacts with a button inside the notification.
Carousel Object Select
: Triggered when a user selects an item in a carousel notification.
To enable these callbacks in your React Native project, follow the steps below:
Step 1: Create
NetmeraPushHeadlessTask.js
Create a new file named
NetmeraPushHeadlessTask.js
in your React Native project and define the callback functions:
export
const
onPushRegister
async
(message)
console
.log
"onPushRegister: "
message);
export
const
onPushReceive
async
(message)
console
.log
"onPushReceive: "
message);
export
const
onPushOpen
async
(message)
console
.log
"onPushOpen: "
message);
export
const
onPushDismiss
async
(message)
console
.log
"onPushDismiss: "
message);
export
const
onPushButtonClicked
async
(message)
console
.log
"onPushButtonClicked: "
message);
export
const
onCarouselObjectSelected
async
(message)
console
.log
"onCarouselObjectSelected: "
message);
Step 2: Initialize
NetmeraBroadcastReceiver
index.js
In your
index.js
file, import the callback functions and initialize
NetmeraBroadcastReceiver
import {
onCarouselObjectSelected,
onPushButtonClicked,
onPushDismiss,
onPushOpen,
onPushReceive,
onPushRegister
} from "./NetmeraPushHeadlessTask";
Netmera.initBroadcastReceiver(
onPushRegister,
onPushReceive,
onPushOpen,
onPushDismiss,
onPushButtonClicked,
onCarouselObjectSelected
// Ensure this is called after `Netmera.initBroadcastReceiver`
AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
