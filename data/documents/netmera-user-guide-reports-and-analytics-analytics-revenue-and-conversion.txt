Analytics
Revenue and Conversion
Analyzing your campaign’s success starts with understanding two key metrics:
Revenue
and
Conversion
. In Netmera, these metrics help you measure both the financial return and the effectiveness of your engagement strategies.
What is Revenue?
Revenue refers to the total income generated from user actions—typically from "Purchase" events. In Netmera, revenue is automatically tracked when users complete a purchase. This metric helps you evaluate the financial impact of your campaigns and user activities.
What is Conversion?
Conversion measures whether users took the desired action after seeing your campaign. You may set your Conversion Events while creating your campaigns on Step 2: What. This could be a purchase, sign-up, or any other custom event you define in Netmera. It’s not always about money—it’s about tracking successful events based on your goals.
Conversion vs. Revenue
Revenue
reflects the
financial
outcome of a campaign.
Conversion
reflects the
goal completion
, whether it’s financial or not.
A purchase event can count toward both metrics, but conversion allows more flexibility by including other events as well.

Revenue-Conversion Dashboard
lets you analyze performance across campaigns by filtering key parameters:
