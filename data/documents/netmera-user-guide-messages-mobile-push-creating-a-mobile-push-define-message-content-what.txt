Message Content
Message Category
Purpose: Organize your campaigns based on their function or content.
Use the Category field to classify your campaign under a label such as:
Promotions
Announcements
Account Alerts
Transactional Messages
Categorizing helps with future campaign filtering, reporting, and analytics.
Notification Message (Body)
Purpose: Communicates the primary message to users.
This is the main text content of your push notification. Keep it:
Informative
Concise
Action-oriented
You may use text and emojis for added emphasis and visual appeal.
Example:
‚ÄúYour payment was successful üéâ‚Äù or
‚Äúüö® Suspicious login detected. Tap to secure your account.‚Äù

Personalized Message
Purpose: Increases engagement by tailoring content using user profile data.
You can personalize messages using attributes such as name, age, or preferences stored in Netmera. Use {@attribute} syntax or the dropdown selector to insert available attributes. You must create profile attributes before using them in your notifications.
Example:
Default: ‚ÄúHappy birthday!‚Äù
Personalized: ‚ÄúWishing you a sweet {@age}th birthday, {@name}!‚Äù
‚Üí Displays as: ‚ÄúWishing you a sweet 26th birthday, Simon!‚Äù
Use cases include:
Greeting users by name
Recommending products based on past behavior
Sending localized or weather-based messages
Tip: Ensure your app transmits the necessary profile data to Netmera beforehand.
Title
Purpose: Grabs attention and provides immediate context.
Create a compelling notification title that encourages the user to engage. You can use emojis and concise text to improve visibility.
Personalized Title
If user profile data is available, personalize the title for stronger impact.
Example:
‚ÄúHey {@name}, your exclusive offer is here!‚Äù
‚Üí Becomes: ‚ÄúHey Emily, your exclusive offer is here!‚Äù
Personalized titles can:
Increase open rates
Strengthen user-brand connection
Improve retention metrics

Subtext
Purpose: Adds secondary context, shown next to your app‚Äôs name.
Subtext supports personalization and often appears in the notification header on supported devices. It can include:
Additional details
A brief summary
A call to action
Example: ‚ÄúLimited-time offer ¬∑ Ends tonight!‚Äù
Personalized Subtext
You can use the same {@} format or dropdown menu to insert dynamic user data into the subtext.
Example:
‚ÄúYour challenge score: {@score}‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúYour challenge score: 850‚Äù

Custom Push Icon
Purpose: Displays a custom app logo or image beside the notification (platform-specific).
Requires SDK integration.
If not configured, the default icon from your app settings will be used.
Refer to:
iOS Push Icon Page
Android Push Icon Page
When Custom Push is Turned Off:
If a default notification icon is provided and custom push icon is turned off, the default icon from the Developer App Info will be used.

Android/iOS Thumbnail URL
Purpose: Displays a thumbnail image alongside the notification text.
Can be uploaded or referenced via direct URL.
Offers a static, non-expandable visual.
Ideal for logos, product previews, or branded content.

Android/iOS Media URL

Use this to:
Avoid disturbing the user
Provide contextual messages inside the app
Play Sound
Requires SDK integration
This option needs integration, please refer to Developer Guide. After you have integrated this option with your developers, you may choose this option on this step. 
After setup, you can upload or select a custom sound to play when the notification arrives.
Use distinct sounds for priority messages
Ensure sound files meet platform requirements
Disable Webhooks
When this option is enabled, any webhooks connected to the campaign are deactivated for this notification.

Sending isolated notifications that should not trigger backend workflows
Push Click Actions
The Click Action defines what happens when a user taps the notification. Each action allows you to create specific user journeys based on your campaign goals.

Available Actions
1. Open App:  
   Opens the app's main screen. Suitable for general awareness messages.
2. Show Web Page:  
   Opens a specific URL in the device's browser. Useful for external content or promotions.
3. Go to Deeplink:  
   Navigates to a specific screen in the app using a deeplink URL. Ideal for contextual or personalized experiences.
4. Show Custom Page:  
   Displays an in-app landing page or message. Great for promos or targeted in-app content.
5. Open Widget:  
   Opens a widget already defined in your app. Widgets must be created in advance.
6. Nothing:  
   No action is taken. The notification is dismissed. Used for informational alerts.

Open App
Opens the main screen or homepage of your app. Ideal for general engagement campaigns where no specific destination is required.
Show Web Page
Opens a web page in the device‚Äôs browser. A valid URL must be entered. Useful for:
Redirecting users to campaign-specific landing pages.
Linking to help center articles.
Promoting time-sensitive offers.
Go to Deeplink
Navigates users to a specific page or section within your app using a deeplink. This is recommended for personalized or feature-specific campaigns.
You can choose from a list of predefined deeplinks or input a custom one.
Deeplinks must be registered in your app‚Äôs routing system.
Show Custom Page
Displays a custom in-app page. Often used for:
In-app promotional screens.
Full-screen messages.
Targeted announcements without navigating away from the app.
Open Widget
Triggers an in-app widget. Widgets must be created in advance and can be used to:
Collect feedback.
Display dynamic offers.

Surveys & Feedback Forms: Prompt users to complete a short survey or provide feedback.
Live Reports & Dashboards: Show real-time analytics, personalized reports, or updates.
Product Recommendations: Display items or content tailored to the user's interests.
Gamification with Spin to Win: Engage users with gamified elements.
Quick Actions: Enable users to complete actions like confirming appointments, redeeming offers, or checking their latest transactions.

Nothing
No action is triggered; the notification is dismissed. This is suitable for passive updates such as:
Informational alerts.
Background data sync confirmations.

Add Custom Parameters
Enhance push behavior with additional key-value data passed alongside the notification. These parameters can be read and interpreted by the app upon user click.
1. Key:  
   Parameter name (e.g., campaignId, source).
2. Value:  
   Corresponding value (e.g., spring2025, web).
3. Action:  
   Click "Add" to include the parameter.
Example Use Cases:
Open App ‚Üí add type: promotion, id: 12345
Show Web Page ‚Üí add url: https://example.com/special

Web Hook for Push Click
When enabled, the WebhookClick event is triggered upon notification interaction. This allows your backend systems to log or respond to click events in real time.
1. Web Hook:  
   Select a webhook endpoint from your system.
2. pushParameter:  
   Pass additional data (e.g., campaign type, user ID, offer ID).
Example Use Case:
Click triggers a webhook that logs the event and updates CRM with user behavior context.

Set User a Profile Attribute
Updates user profile data upon click. This is useful for segmentation and campaign personalization.
1. Attribute:  
   Name of the attribute (e.g., Status)
2. Value:  
   New value to be assigned (e.g., Active)
Example Use Case:
Clicking a loyalty campaign updates LoyaltyStatus to Gold.

Example Use
Suppose you want to update a user's credit limit when they click on a push notification:
Enter "CreditLimit" as the attribute name.
Input the desired credit limit value in the text box.
This configuration ensures that when the notification is clicked, the user's profile is updated with the new credit limit. It's like filling out a form to set someone's credit limit. When they press the button (click the notification), the limit gets updated automatically.
Put User in a Tag
This option allows you to assign a tag to the user. Tags are used to group users based on specific characteristics or behaviors. For instance, you might use tags like "VIP", "Newsletter Subscriber", or "Frequent Buyer".
If the tag name you enter already exists, the user will be added to that existing tag rather than creating a new one.

Fallback
Fallback scenarios can be thought of as a backup plan in case your push notification fails to reach its intended audience. By creating a fallback scenario, you can ensure that users who do not receive your push notification can still receive the message through an alternative channel, such as SMS.
Example Use Case:
If the push is undelivered within X minutes, an SMS is sent with similar content.

Label
Campaign labels allow internal users to organize and filter campaigns more effectively. Unlike tags or attributes, labels are for internal tracking and do not affect segmentation or targeting.
Example Labels:
New Users
Promo_May2025
Onboarding_Step1
Use labels to streamline campaign reporting and searchability, especially for teams managing high campaign volumes.

Conversion Analytics
Measure post-click behavior by setting conversion events. Helps quantify the impact of your notification campaign.
1. Purchase Event:  
   Track how many users bought after clicking.
2. Registration Event:  
   Measure new signups triggered by the notification.
3. View Content:  
   See if users viewed a specific screen or item.
Multiple events can be tracked per campaign.
Data is available in real-time on the Netmera Dashboard.

Control Group
The Control Group option enables data-backed performance evaluation. A selected percentage of your audience is excluded from the push to compare outcomes.
Example:
Out of 100,000 users, setting a 1% control group sends the push to 99,000. The behavior of the 1,000 unnotified users is compared against the recipients.
Use control groups to attribute campaign impact with higher confidence.
