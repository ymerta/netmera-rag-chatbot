Basics of Tags
In Netmera, the process of tagging your audience is labeling or categorizing individuals based on their shared characteristics or interests. It's like putting sticky notes on different groups of people so that you can easily identify them later. 
These tags serve as handy markers that help you create more personalized and targeted communication. For example, you can tag users who are interested in a specific product, allowing you to send them relevant updates or offers. This tagging system simplifies the process of tailoring your messages to different segments of your audience, making your communication more engaging and relevant.
