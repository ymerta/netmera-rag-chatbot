Reports for Messages
The key distinctions between a "Report for Automated/Transactional/Geofence Messages" and a "Report for Send Messages" are grounded in the nature of the campaigns or messages they monitor and the associated data they provide:
Automation
These reports focus on automated, transactional, or geofence-triggered messages. Messages in this category are typically dispatched based on predefined triggers or scenarios, which may include user actions, specific events, or geographical location. For example, an automated message might be sent to a user who has abandoned their shopping cart on an e-commerce site, a transactional message might confirm a recent purchase, and a geofence-triggered message might welcome a user to a physical store when they enter a specific area.
Data Source
The data for these messages comes from campaigns that are configured to run automatically, guided by predefined rules or specific user interactions. Whether it's an abandoned cart, a completed purchase, or a user entering a geofenced location, these messages are highly personalized and event-driven.
Report for Send Messages
Manual Campaigns
These reports pertain to messages sent manually as part of planned marketing campaigns. Unlike automated, transactional, or geofence-triggered messages, they are not automatically triggered but are initiated by marketing teams according to predefined scenarios or strategic plans. These messages are often part of broader marketing strategies, such as newsletters or promotional campaigns.
Data Source
Send message reports compile data from campaigns that are initiated and managed by the marketing team. These campaigns may encompass mass communications to a selected audience, such as newsletters, promotional messages, or announcements.
Key Takeaways:
Automated, transactional, and geofence-triggered message reports focus on delivering highly personalized and event-driven messages, often initiated by user interactions or predefined scenarios.
Send message reports center around messages sent as part of planned marketing campaigns, initiated manually by the marketing team. These messages are typically part of broader marketing strategies and may target specific audiences.
While both types of reports encompass common metrics like open rates, conversions, and success indicators, the primary differentiation lies in the automation aspect and the source of data for each message type.
Report Analysis
Start Date
This column records the precise date and time when each automated campaign was initiated. It allows for tracking the exact moment when the campaign began.
Campaign Id
The "Campaign Id" serves as a unique numerical identifier for each automated campaign. It is particularly useful for internal tracking, referencing, and data organization, enabling efficient management of multiple campaigns.
Campaign Name 
In this column, you find the descriptive name of each automated campaign. The "Campaign Name" succinctly outlines the purpose or content of the campaign, providing instant clarity.
Campaign Title
The "Campaign Title" is a more condensed and engaging version of the campaign's name. It is often used to grab recipients' attention and spark interest in the message.

Scenario
In this column, you find a brief description of the scenario or trigger that initiates the automated message. Understanding the scenario provides context for why and when the message is sent.

In summary, the primary difference is in the origin and nature of the messagesâ€”automated messages are event-driven, while send messages are manually initiated as part of planned campaigns.
