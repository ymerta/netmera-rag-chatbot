Sending a Push Notification with Vibration for Android
To enable vibration in your Android application, add the following permission to your
AndroidManifest.xml
file as a direct child of the
<manifest>
element:
uses
permission android
name
"android.permission.VIBRATE"
Afterward, ensure that vibration is enabled in the "What" tab while creating a campaign.
Adding Custom Sound to Your Project
You have the option to customize push notification sounds for different messages. Here's how to do it:
Include your sound files in the
"res/raw"
directory within your Android project.
Sound File Formats:
File extensions for sound files must be one of the following:
.wav
.caf
Custom sounds should not exceed a maximum length of 30 seconds.
Navigate to
Developers > Sound > Create New Sound
While creating the sound, use the file extensions in the "Sound FileName" field. When referencing files, use only the filename (without the extension) for Android.
Select the desired sound name from the drop-down menu. All items in the menu are sound files whose extensions match the supported push sound extensions (
.aiff, .wav, .caf)
Why Does My Notification Play Default Sound?
Exceeding the Limit:
If any sound file exceeds the 30-second limit, the default sound of your phone will play instead of your custom sound.
Sound File Location:
Ensure that the sound file is included in your main bundle; otherwise, the default phone sound will be played when receiving push notifications.
Sending Push Notifications with Sound
To send push notifications with sound, enable the "Play Sound" option on the "What" tab when creating a new push. If you choose "Default," the device's default sound will play, provided that sound is enabled in the device settings.
