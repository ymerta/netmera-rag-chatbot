Customer Data
IYS Permission Hub
IYS Sync Mode
The İleti Yönetim Sistemi (İYS) enables consumers in Turkey to manage their
opt-in
and
opt-out
preferences for electronic communications such as
SMS, email, and voice calls
It also requires businesses to
register and maintain consent records
in a standardized way.
Netmera provides a
built-in integration with İYS
so you can securely synchronize user communication permissions without manual overhead
Before you begin:
Make sure you have your
Brand Code
and
İYS Code
ready from the İYS platform.
Two Modes of IYS Integration
Mode
Description
IYS Sync Mode
IYS is the master source and Netmera regularly imports consent data
Netmera can
read
and
update
existing user records in IYS but cannot create new users.
IYS Integrator Mode
Netmera manages permissions and updates IYS directly
Netmera can
create
your brand entry under a user’s IYS profile and
push
consent
records
directly to IYS.
Step 1: Access the Connectors Section
In your
Netmera Panel
, navigate to
Connectors
Locate
İleti Yönetim Sistemi
under
Data Security
Click
Install
to start the integration.
Step 2: Enter Your İYS Credentials
When prompted:
Brand Code:
Retrieved from your İYS account.
İYS Code:
Retrieved from your İYS account.
These codes are required to activate the connector.
Optional settings:
Via Integration: If you want to use Via, select the checkbox.
See detailed documentation
here
for configuration instructions.)
İYS Integrator: If you want Netmera to act as the source for updating İYS records, check İYS Integrator and continue from the
IYS Integrator Mode
page.
Authorizing Netmera in the İYS Panel
To enable full functionality, you must authorize Netmera within the İYS platform:
Log in to your IYS Panel.
Go to the
İş Ortaklığı (Partnerships)
section.
Search for and select
Netmera
as your solution partner.
Make sure the following permissions are enabled:
Message Permissions
Call Permissions
Email Permissions
This step allows Netmera to receive and manage user permission data on your behalf, ensuring that all communication is aligned with İYS regulations.
Once the connector is installed,
Netmera will automatically begin syncing user permissions
with İYS.
The
initial synchronization
starts overnight and runs in batches until all existing user records are processed.
After the initial sync is complete, Netmera will continue to
update user permissions
based on your latest İYS data.
Updating User Permissions
After synchronizing your data with IYS, you can update existing user permissions in
Targeting > Contact Upload
Please note:
IYS Sync
can only
read
and
update
permissions for users
who already exist
in your IYS records.
You cannot create new users in IYS
via this process.
To create your brand entry under a user’s IYS profile and send consent records directly to IYS, you must use the
IYS Integrator Mode
Once you
synchronize
your data with IYS, you can
update
your
user's current permission
through
Targeting > Contact Upload
Contact Upload with IYS Integration
You can upload user data via CSV or TXT files under
Targeting > Contact Upload
. When your file contains any of the following identifiers, Netmera will match and update the corresponding user profile and
update
their status in Netmara Panel and İYS:
email
phonenumber
external_id
Netmera uses these identifiers to locate the user and apply the latest permissions.
The newest upload always overrides existing data.
For every user in the uploaded file, you must also include the following IYS-specific fields:
IYSSource
IYSConsentDate
IYSStatus
Field Matching
During upload, you'll be prompted to match columns in your file to profile attributes in Netmera. If column headers match existing attributes (e.g.,
email
external_id
phonenumber
), they’ll be auto-detected.
Required Columns in IYS Integrator Mode
IYSource
: The consent collection channel. Must be one of the following values:
IYSStatus
: Consent status must be either
ONAY
(approved) or
RET
(rejected).
IYSConsentDate
: Consent timestamp in the format
dd.mm.yy hh:mm:ss
email / phonenumber
: You must upload at least one (email or phone number). You may upload both, provided the consent status (
ONAY
RET
) is the same for both channels.
Optional Columns
External ID
: An external ID for the user. If not provided, users will be matched by their email or phone number.
If any required IYS fields are missing, the upload is blocked. If fields are partially filled or contain errors, affected users are created as
optout
Country code is mandatory
in phone number values (e.g., +905XXXXXXXXX)
If email and phone number have different consent statuses, do not upload in the same file.
Adding Profile Attributes
After defining the required identifiers (
email
phonenumber
, or
external_id
) and IYS-specific fields (
IYSSource
IYSStatus
IYSConsentDate
), you may include additional
profile attributes
as extra columns in your upload file.
Before uploading the file, all profile attributes you intend to use must be
pre-configured
in the Netmera Panel under
Developers > Profile Attributes
. If they are not pre-configured, you will receive an error notification in the
result screen
indicating which columns were unmatched or ignored.
Status Selection
During upload, select one of the following statuses:
Subscribed / Unsubscribed
If this status is selected:
IYS fields are
optional
Use when uploading users with fixed consent values (all optin or all optout)
Note:
Users added in this flow
won’t be updated in IYS.
IYS Syncronize
Enables consent synchronization between Netmera and IYS. File must include IYS fields.
You must
choose
this option to update your data to IYS through your uploaded file.
Step 4: Matching Contact Information
After uploading your contact file, you’ll be taken to the Profile Attributes screen. This step ensures that the columns in your file are accurately mapped to Netmera’s profile attributes.
In this screen:
System-required fields like
IYSSource
IYSStatus
, and
IYSConsentDate
will be automatically matched if named correctly.
Additional fields such as
surname
, or
address
will also be listed as profile attributes.
A total count of columns to be imported is shown at the bottom.
What to Do If Any Field Appears Red
If any field appears in
red
, it means the column header does not match any pre-configured profile attribute in Netmera.
To resolve this, click the ✏️
Edit
icon and select the appropriate profile attribute from the dropdown.
Once all mappings are correct, click
Save
to proceed.
If any custom attribute in your file has not been pre-configured in Netmera’s panel (
Developers > Profile Attributes
), it must be created
before
uploading. Otherwise, it will not be imported, and you will receive an error prompt during the upload summary.
Once you upload your files to Netmera, processing times depend on the IYS systems:
Updating users permissions
: When you are updating an existing contact, it may take
2–3 hours
to complete.

Best Practices
Use consistent and accurate formatting for date fields and phone number (SMS).
If uploading mixed-consent users,
split them into separate files
