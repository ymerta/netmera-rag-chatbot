Create a New Experience
Setup and Rules
Web Tools -> Experiences -> Web Personalization -> Publish a New Experience
Step 1. Setup
Click the "Publish New Personalization Experience" button in the upper right.
Ensure each experience has a unique name; you cannot use the same name more than once.
Step 2. Rules
In the "Publish New Experience" pages "
Rules
" section, you have five functions. You can select the trigger type, the page you want to modify, add changes, apply filters, and schedule your experience.
Trigger Type
The default trigger type is "
page load
," recommended for most websites, except for single-page applications, which require the "
continuous

Changes
In the "Changes" section, you can make modifications by entering the URL of the page you want to change and clicking the "Add Changes" button. No need to enter URL information for changes on the home page. When entering URL information,

not the entire URL. For example, to make changes to "www.netmera.com/products" page, type "/products" in the Page field.
