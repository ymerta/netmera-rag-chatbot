Customer Data
Profile Attributes
Define who your users are. Personalize what they experience.
Profile Attributes are a core part of how Netmera helps you understand and engage your users. They represent structured pieces of information tied to individual customer profiles, forming the foundation of segmentation, targeting, and personalization across the platform.
From basic identifiers to advanced behavioral traits, Profile Attributes allow you to create meaningful user models that fuel real-time decision-making and tailored communication strategies.
What Are Profile Attributes?
Every user profile in Netmera can include a variety of attributes. These may range from standard fields like name or email to business-specific values such as membership tier, last order amount, or preferred product category.
This flexibility enables you to build rich, actionable customer profiles that support smarter engagement across mobile, web, email, and more.
