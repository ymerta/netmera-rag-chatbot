Customer Data
Profile Attributes
Digital Representations of Your Customers
Profile Attributes in Netmera are the building blocks of comprehensive customer data analysis and personalized engagement strategies. Profile Attributes are
static
pieces of information associated with
individual customer profiles.
These attributes are the digital representations of various pieces of information about your customers, providing valuable insights that drive omnichannel customer engagement.
In essence, Profile Attributes are details attached to each customer's profile within the Netmera platform. These details can encompass a wide range of information, from basic demographics like names and locations to more specific data such as purchase history, preferences, and interaction behaviors. The versatility of Profile Attributes allows you to create a detailed, 360-degree view of each customer.
Profile Attributes Dashboard
The Profile Attributes dashboard within Netmera serves as a central hub for overseeing and harnessing customer data. It encompasses two primary categories of attributes: standard and custom.
Standard and Custom Attributes Dashboard
Standard attributes
, predetermined by Netmera, consist of essential customer details such as names, email addresses, and contact numbers. These standardized fields ensure consistency and conformity to established data structures and industry standards, fostering data accuracy and reliability.
Standard Attributes
Custom attributes
, on the other hand, allow you to introduce specific data points tailored to your unique business requirements. This adaptability is invaluable for capturing specialized customer insights and interactions.
Custom Attributes
Together, these attributes empower you to create a comprehensive profile of your customer base, supporting personalized engagement strategies and data-driven decision-making. The Profile Attributes dashboard not only enhances data management but also enables you to unlock the full potential of your customer data for targeted and effective omnichannel engagement.
To read and interpret the table in the Profile Attributes dashboard effectively, follow these steps:
Column Headers
: Start by understanding the meaning of each column in the table. The headers typically include fields like "Code," "Attribute," "Description," "Is Personal Info," "Calculate Analytics," "Unit," and "Calculated." Familiarize yourself with the purpose of each column.
Code
: The "Code" column is likely a unique identifier for each attribute. It helps differentiate one attribute from another, making it easier to reference them when needed.
Attribute
: The "Attribute" column contains the names or labels of the attributes. This field provides information about the type of data each attribute represents, such as "Email," "Age," or "Location."
Description
: The "Description" column offers a brief explanation of what each attribute represents or its significance within customer profiles. Clear descriptions are essential for understanding the purpose of each attribute.
Is Personal Info
: This column, labeled "Is Personal Info," may indicate whether an attribute contains personal information about customers. It's crucial for privacy and compliance, as attributes marked as personal should only be processed and stored with customer consent.
Calculate Analytics
: Look at the "Calculate Analytics" column to determine if an attribute is used in calculating analytics or metrics. Attributes involved in analytics contribute to data analysis and insights generation.
Unit
: If applicable, the "Unit" column specifies the unit of measurement associated with certain attributes. For instance, if you have an attribute like "Height," the unit might be "inches" or "centimeters." This field clarifies what unit of measurement is used.
Calculated
: Check the "Calculated" column to identify whether an attribute is a calculated field. Calculated fields are often derived from other attributes or data sources. Understanding which attributes are calculated is essential for maintaining data integrity and conducting accurate analyses.
Ethical and Effective Methods for Gathering Customer Personal Information
Acquiring personal information from customers requires a thoughtful and transparent approach, as it involves respecting privacy and obtaining consent. Here are some common ways to gather personal attributes information from customers:
Registration and Account Creation
: When customers sign up for an account on your platform, website, or app, you can request certain personal information as part of the registration process. This might include names, email addresses, and demographic details. Make sure to clearly explain why you're collecting this information and how it will be used.
Surveys and Questionnaires
: Create surveys or questionnaires that customers can voluntarily fill out. These can include questions about their preferences, interests, and demographic information. Ensure that participation is entirely optional, and clarify the purpose of the survey.
Purchase Transactions
: During the checkout process for online purchases, you can collect personal information necessary for processing orders, such as shipping addresses and payment details. Additionally, you can ask customers for their preferences and contact information for order updates or marketing communications.
Newsletter Sign-Ups
: Allow customers to subscribe to newsletters or updates. This is an opportunity to gather their email addresses and perhaps their preferences regarding the types of content they'd like to receive.
User Profiles
: If your platform has user profiles, encourage customers to complete their profiles by providing personal information. You can incentivize this by offering benefits such as personalized recommendations or exclusive content.
User-Generated Content
: If you have interactive features like reviews or comments, customers may voluntarily share personal information in their contributions. Ensure that there are clear guidelines on what is acceptable and how this information may be used.
Mobile Apps
: Mobile apps often request access to device information, location data, and contacts. Be transparent about why you need these permissions and how they enhance the user experience.
Incentives and Rewards
: Offer incentives, such as discounts or exclusive access, in exchange for customers providing certain personal information. Be clear about the value they'll receive in return for sharing their data.
Cookies and Tracking
: Online tracking tools like cookies can provide insights into customer behavior. However, be transparent about your use of cookies and offer options for users to manage their cookie preferences.
Automated synchronization is a method for ensuring that customer data remains current in Netmera without the need for manual intervention. This process generally entails establishing an automated system that regularly refreshes customer information from your source systems (where customer data is originally collected and stored) to Netmera.

Segmentation
: One of the most powerful ways to leverage Profile Attributes is through segmentation. You can use the attributes to categorize your customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. For example, you can create segments for customers of different age groups, geographical locations, or purchase history. This segmentation allows you to:
Targeted Marketing Campaigns
: Tailor your marketing campaigns to each specific segment. For instance, you can send promotions related to winter products to customers in colder regions and summer-related offers to those in warmer areas.
Personalized Messages
: Craft messages and content that resonate with each segment's unique preferences. Customers are more likely to engage with communications that are relevant to their interests and needs.
Customized Offers
: Create offers and discounts that are specific to each segment. This can increase conversion rates and drive customer loyalty.
Personalization
: Personalization is key to creating meaningful connections with your customers. Profile Attributes provide the foundation for personalization by allowing you to understand individual customer preferences, behaviors, and demographics. Here's how you can leverage Profile Attributes for personalization:
Tailored Content
: Customize the content of your emails, push notifications, or in-app messages based on the customer's attributes. For instance, recommend products that align with their past purchases or browsing history.
Recommendations
: Use attributes like purchase history to offer personalized product recommendations. Customers are more likely to make purchases when they see products that match their interests.
Communication Timing
: Personalize the timing of your messages. Some customers may prefer to receive notifications in the morning, while others may be more responsive in the evening. Adjust your communication schedule accordingly.
