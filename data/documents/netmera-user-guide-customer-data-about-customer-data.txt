About Customer Data
The Data Foundation of Smarter Engagement
Netmera is built to help you engage users in the most personal, timely, and effective ways. At the center of that promise lies
Customer Data
— a powerful module that enables you to capture, unify, and act on the information that defines your users.
This is more than just user storage. Customer Data acts as a
strategic data layer
that connects identity, behavior, and consent — empowering every campaign, journey, and automation you run inside Netmera.
Profile Attributes
Profile Attributes are structured fields that describe each user. You can store anything from basic contact info to custom traits like membership level, favorite category, or device type.
Create custom attributes tailored to your business
Use in segmentation, personalization, and journey triggers
Device Metadata
Events
Understand what your users do in real time.
Events capture user actions like button clicks, logins, purchases, or onboarding steps. These signals are essential for powering behavioral targeting and automation logic across Netmera.
Built-in and custom event tracking
Parameter support for richer data
Visualize user actions in Event Insight
Tagless Data Capture
Collect more, configure less.
Not every product team has time for manual tagging. Tagless Data Capture lets you gather behavioral data from your website or app automatically, helping you get started faster and track more with less code.
IYS Permission Hub
In markets like Turkey, permission data is not optional — it’s regulated. Netmera’s IYS Permission Hub ensures your user profiles stay compliant with Ileti Yönetim Sistemi (IYS) requirements, with two flexible operational modes:
IYS Baseline Sync
mirrors IYS permission data into Netmera
IYS Authority Mode
lets Netmera manage and push consents directly to IYS
This ensures that your outreach remains legal, ethical, and audit-ready: no extra effort required.
Why Customer Data Powers the Whole Platform
Customer Data isn’t a silo, it’s a shared source of truth for your entire engagement strategy.
Every attribute, event, and permission feeds directly into Netmera’s:
Campaign targeting
Audience segmentation
Journey triggers
Personalization logic
Message eligibility filters
and advanced analytics
By treating data as the starting point for engagement, not just a reporting layer. Netmera helps you create more relevant, effective, and responsible user experiences.
