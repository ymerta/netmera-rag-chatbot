REST API
Setup
To access Netmeraâ€™s REST API, you must include your
REST API key
in the request headers.
Log in to the
Netmera Panel
Navigate to:
Developers > API
REST API key
from the provided field.
Use
only the REST API key
(not JavaScript or mobile keys) for REST API requests.
Include the API key in the
X-netmera-api-key
header of your request.
Example:
curl -X POST https:
//restapi.netmera.com/rest/3.0/sendBulkNotification \
"Content-Type: application/json"
-d '{
"extId"
"user123"
"notification"
"title"
"Hello"
"message"
"Welcome to Netmera!"
Always include the header
Content-Type: application/json
when sending JSON payloads.
What is
extId
(External ID)?
The
extId
is the unique identifier you assign to a
user
in your system. It ensures consistency across devices and platforms.
It must be
unique per user
Used to group all app installations (e.g., smartphone, tablet) under a single user.
Required in most REST API requests (e.g., inbox retrieval, status update).
Example:
If John uses your app on both an iPhone and an iPad:
Both installations should send the same
extId
, e.g.,
"extId": "john123"
Netmera recognizes these as different devices belonging to the same user.
