Unlocking Digital Communication with İleti Yönetim Sistemi (IYS)
In a groundbreaking move on March 10, 2021, Turkey introduced İleti Yönetim Sistemi (IYS), reshaping the dynamics of commercial electronic messages. This pivotal framework intricately manages communication permissions, consumer choices, and legal obligations, influencing how businesses and consumers engage in the digital sphere.
