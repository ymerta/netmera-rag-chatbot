Customer Data
IYS Integration
The
İleti Yönetim Sistemi
, or
Message Management System
, allows consumers to manage their opt-in and opt-out preferences for electronic communications such as SMS, email, and voice calls. At the same time, it requires businesses to register and manage consent records systematically.
Integrating İYS with Netmera
Netmera offers a built-in integration with İYS to help you synchronize your users' communication permissions securely and efficiently.
Note:
Make sure you have access to your brand’s IYS credentials before starting the integration.
Follow these steps to connect your İYS account with Netmera:
Go to the Connectors Section
In your Netmera panel, navigate to the
Connectors
section and find the list of available connectors.
Select İleti Yönetim Sistemi under Data Security
Choose
Data Security > İleti Yönetim Sistemi
, then click
Install
to start the integration.
Enter Your Brand and IYS Codes
When prompted, enter your
Brand Code
and
IYS Code
(retrieved from your IYS account). These are required to activate the connector.
Once the connector is installed, Netmera will automatically begin syncing user permissions with İYS. The synchronization process starts during the night of installation and continues in batches until all users are processed.
Authorizing Netmera in the İYS Panel
To enable full functionality, you must authorize Netmera within the İYS platform:
Log in to your IYS Panel.
Go to the
İş Ortaklığı (Partnerships)
section.
Search for and select
Netmera
as your solution partner.
Make sure the following permissions are enabled:
Message Permissions
Call Permissions
Email Permissions
This step allows Netmera to receive and manage user permission data on your behalf, ensuring that all communication is aligned with İYS regulations.
Uploading Email and SMS Data for İYS Sync
