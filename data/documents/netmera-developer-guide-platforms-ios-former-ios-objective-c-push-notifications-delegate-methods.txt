Delegate Methods
Default Handling of Remote Notifications
Netmera automatically handles all
UIApplicationDelegate
methods related to remote notifications. You donâ€™t need to implement these methods in your
App Delegate
unless your app has special use cases that require custom logic.
Custom Implementation (If Needed)
If your app needs custom handling for remote notification delegate methods, you can implement them in your
UIApplicationDelegate
. You can then add your specific logic inside those methods. For more details on the delegate methods related to push notifications, check the:
UI Application Delegate Protocol Reference
Accessing Notification Data
To retrieve the remote notification payload, use the
[Netmera recentPushObject]
Netmera.recentPushObject()
method. This method returns a
NetmeraPushObject
instance, which contains the notification data. You can call this method within your
UIApplicationDelegate
methods to access the data of the received notification.
