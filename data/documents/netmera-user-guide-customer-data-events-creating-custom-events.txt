Creating Custom Events
Quick Steps Guidelines
Developer > Events > Create New Event
Navigate to the Developers > Events section in the Netmera Dashboard.
Click the "Create New Event" button.
Define the event attributes, data types, and specify mandatory parameters as needed. 
After creating a custom event, Netmera Dashboard will automatically generate the necessary code and source files for your event.
Developers will fire the event you have created on Netmera Panel. Please read through our guide How to Fire Events to understand how to fire an event you generate in your Netmera Panel. 
Step 1: Event Details
Provide the following details for your event:
Event Name: This is the name of the event as it will be used in your application's code. Choose a descriptive and unique name that represents the action or behavior you want to track.
Event Label: The event label is used in the control panel screens and reports within Netmera. It should be a user-friendly name that helps you easily identify the event in the interface.
Event Description: Write a brief description that explains the purpose and significance of the event. This will help other team members understand its usage.
Base Event (optional): If your custom event is an extension or modification of a standard event provided by Netmera, you can select the base event here. This helps maintain consistency and categorization within your event tracking.
Step 2: Attributes
You need to define the attributes for your custom event. Attributes provide additional context and information about the event. Each attribute has its own properties:
Attribute Create
Data Type: Choose the appropriate data type for your attribute. Netmera supports various data types such as string, integer, double, boolean, date, long, and timestamp.

DataType: String
Definition: A sequence of characters, digits, or symbols treated as text.
Examples: "hello", "+1-999-666-3333"

DataType: Integer
Definition: Numeric data without decimal fractions.
Examples: -707, 0, 707

DataType: Double
Definition: Real numbers including decimals and scientific notation. Can hold 15-16 digits before/after the decimal.
Examples: 4.5672, -5.22234, 0.15197e-7

DataType: Boolean
Definition: Represents true or false values.
Examples: 0 (false), 1 (true)

DataType: Date
Definition: A date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Examples: 2021-09-28

DataType: Long
Definition: Large 32- or 64-bit integers.
Examples: -2147483648 to 2147483647

DataType: Timestamp
Definition: Number of seconds since Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).
Examples: 1632855600

Name: Provide a descriptive name for the attribute.
Label: The label is used in the control panel screens and reports within Netmera to identify the attribute.
Mandatory: Specify whether the attribute is mandatory or optional for the event. This helps ensure that the necessary data is captured.
Array: If the attribute can have multiple values, enable the array option. This is useful when tracking events with multiple selections or choices.
Private Info: If the attribute contains sensitive or personally identifiable information, mark it as private info to handle it according to privacy regulations.
Code: Assigned unique code to each attribute. This code will be used in your application's code to reference the attribute.

Step 3: Adding More Attributes on Attribute Creation
Repeat the attribute creation process as needed for your custom event, adding all the relevant attributes that provide valuable context and information.
Review your event details and attribute configurations to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Step 4: Save and Generate Code
After Creating a Custom Event
Once you've successfully created a custom event using the Netmera Dashboard, integrating it into your project becomes a straightforward process. The Netmera Dashboard automates the generation of the necessary code for your custom event, making it effortless. Here's how it works:
Event Configuration: After defining the attributes, data types, and mandatory parameters for your custom event within the Netmera Dashboard, save your event configuration.
Code Generation: To obtain the code for your custom event, simply navigate to the bottom of the event configuration page and click the "Save and Generate Code" button.
By taking this step, the Netmera Dashboard instantly generates the required code snippets and source files specifically tailored to your custom event. These generated files are ready for integration into your project, ensuring that your custom event tracking seamlessly becomes part of your application.
Step 5: Fire Event
Ask your developers to read through our Netmera Developer Guide on "How to Fire Events" that you have generated the code for in your Netmera Panel. It is a comprehensive guide guiding your developers fire your desired event with the generated code in your applications.
Importing Events to Apps
If you have multiple apps in the Netmera Panel, you can import events from one app to another. This lets you reuse events across apps efficiently.
Go to the Developers section and select Events.
Click Import Event Definition.
Choose the Application Name from which you want to import events.

Select the specific custom event(s) you want to import.
Click the Import button in the Action section.
