Email Delivery Onboarding
The email sending onboarding process is designed to help you transition smoothly into high-volume email sending while protecting your sender reputation and ensuring high deliverability rates. The main goal is to enable bulk email delivery to large datasets without risking the reputation of your sending IP addresses.

is a gradual process where email volume is increased steadily over time. It starts by sending emails to small, highly engaged segments, then expands to larger audiences. This helps:
Build a strong sender reputation
Gain trust from ISPs and email recipients
Improve inbox placement
