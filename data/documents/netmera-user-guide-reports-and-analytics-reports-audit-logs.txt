Audit Logs
Within the Netmera platform, "
Audit Logs"
serve as a meticulous record of every action and event that transpires
within the Netmera Panel system.
These logs offer a comprehensive view of user activities, system events, and changes made over time. They include details such as who performed specific actions, what those actions were, and when they occurred.
Tip:
In practical terms, Audit Logs can reveal a wealth of information. For instance, they can show who accessed a particular screen, how many times it was accessed, and whether any modifications were made while on that screen. Audit Logs can also highlight user login/logout times, content creation or modification, and interactions with specific features.
User Action
"User Action" is a specific event or activity initiated by a user within the Netmera platform. It encompasses actions such as logging in, creating or modifying content, accessing specific features, or making configuration changes. User actions are logged in the audit trail to provide a detailed account of who did what and when within the system.
Log Date
This represents the date on which a specific user action or event occurred within Netmera. It allows you to pinpoint when a particular action was taken, aiding in tracking and investigating system activities.
