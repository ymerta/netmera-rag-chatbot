Automated Messages
Whether it's a user signing up for your app, completing a purchase, reaching a milestone, or abandoning a cart, you can design custom scenarios to engage and re-engage your users.
Automated Push Scenarios offer endless possibilities for engaging with your users. You can nurture new users with onboarding sequences, provide personalized recommendations, re-engage inactive users with win-back campaigns, and deliver relevant updates or promotions based on their
preferences
and
behavior
. By leveraging the power of automation, you can create
dynamic and impactful push notification campaigns
that drive user
retention
and
loyalty

Quick Steps
Option 1: User Action
For User Action, there are four options to choose from. They are Increase Retention, Increase App Conversion, Handle Special User Action and Merge Events.
Increase Retention
To increase retention, you can create automated messages that are sent based on a user's actions or inaction
after a certain period of time.
For instance, an automated message can be created for a message to be sent 2 hours after the user installs the application.
The messages can be sent to all devices or most recent devices of users.
Steps
In the
Event
section, select the specific action or event that will activate the message.
Use the
Period
section to set the time interval during which the message will be sent.
To send the message to all devices owned by the user, select the
Send message to all devices of user
option.
To send the message to only the user's most recently used device, select the
Send message to last used device of user
option.
Example:
You may send a welcome message to users 24 hours after they first download and install your app, encouraging them to explore its features or remind users who have abandoned their shopping cart to complete their purchase, offering a discount or free shipping to incentivize them.
Increase Retention
Increase App Conversion
Automated push messages can be triggered based on the user's actions or inaction
over a specific period of time.
For example, if a user clicks on a push notification but doesn't make a purchase within a certain time frame, an automated message can be scheduled to be sent. These messages are sent based on the presence or absence of specific events and can be sent to either all devices or only the most recent devices of users.
Steps
Select at least
two events
(Event 1 and Event 2).
You may add a third optional event that is added to the second event with an
logical operator.
Choose a time interval for the message using the "
Period
" option.
Alternatively, use the "
Time Specific
" option to set a start, end, and send time for the message.
Example:
You may send a push notification to users who have previously made a purchase but have not returned in a certain period of time, offering them a special deal or promotion to encourage them to make a new purchase Or you may encourage users who have not yet made a purchase to do so with a message highlighting the benefits of your product or service.
Increase Retention or Increase App Conversion?
"Increase Retention" messages are triggered based on an action performed or not performed at a certain period of time. For example, a message can be sent to a user two hours after they install an application to encourage them to continue using the app.
On the other hand, "Increase App Conversion" messages are triggered by specific events or the absence of specific events over a specific period of time. For instance, if a user clicks on a push notification but doesn't make a purchase
within a certain time frame, an automated message can be set up to be sent to encourage them to complete the purchase.
In summary, "Increase Retention" messages are focused on encouraging users to continue using the app, while "Increase App Conversion" messages are aimed at encouraging users to complete specific actions, such as making a purchase.
Increase App Conversion
Handle Special User Action
To handle special user actions, you can set up automated push notifications based on the
frequency of certain actions
, such as sending a message when a user makes a second in-app purchase. Again, these messages can be sent to all or most recent devices of users.
Steps
In the "
Goal
" section, select the event that triggers the automated message.
In the "
Occurrence
" section, select how many times the event needs to occur before the automated message is sent.
In the "
Capture Events in
" section, specify the time interval for the event. For example, if the user uninstalls the app for the second time within one hour, send the automated message. For example if your user uninstall app 2nd time in 1 hour send automated message.
Example:
You may congratulate users who have reached a certain milestone, such as completing 100 purchases or running a marathon, with a personalized message and special offer or encourage users who have previously left a positive review to share it with their friends and family, offering them an additional discount or reward for doing so.
Handle Special User Action
Merge Events
With Merge Events, you can create automation scenarios that trigger a single set of actions when multiple events occur in a specific order.
In the event type section, you select the events and event attributes that you want to track, and then assign a desired event key to each event. This enables you to build automation scenarios that are tailored to your needs.
Steps
In the "
Goal
" section, edit the trigger conditions for your automated message by selecting
events
and
event attributes
desired to occur and entering a desired event key in front of each event.
In the "
Timing
" section, select the time conditions for your automated messages (to trigger the message, you can choose "
Events Must be Captured in the Specified Order
" option and determine the time for the next event in the "
Capture Events In
" section after one of the selected events takes place).
If the event is not captured in the chosen period or the next event does not occur at the end of the specified period, a
fallback scenario
is created. Here you may choose a push notification or send a SMS.
In the "
Context
Param Value
). This allows the message to be personalized and specific at the content creation section.
Example:
You may analyze customer journeys and identify key events that signal important milestones, such as account creation or a completed purchase or create targeted campaigns that trigger multiple messages across different channels, such as push notifications, email, and SMS.
Merge Events
In the
Timing
section of Merge Events, there are several options to further specify the automation scenario:
The
"Events must be captured in the specified order"
option ensures that the message is triggered only when the user performs the specified events in the exact order they were set up, according to their priority.
The
"Capture events in"
option sets the time frame within which the next event should occur after one of the selected events takes place.
The
"Send a message if event(s) is not captured in the chosen period"
option enables creating a fallback scenario if the next event does not occur within the specified time frame. This allows for defining the type and content of the fallback message to be sent, in case the user doesn't perform the desired action within the expected time.
Merge Events - Timing
In the
Context
section of Merge Events, you can define attributes corresponding to the event keys that were set up in the Event Type section. This allows you to specify the context of the event and create a personalized message based on that context.
For example, if the event is a user adding an item to their cart, the corresponding attribute could be the name of the item added. This would allow you to create a message that references the specific item added, making it more relevant and personalized to the user.
Merge Events - Context
Campaign Period for User Action Notifications
The
"Campaign Period"
section is where you can set the start and end dates for your automated push campaign. This allows you to limit the duration of the campaign to a specific time period. It is the same with Campaign Push Notifications/Define Campaign Schedule. Therefore, in automated push messages you will not have Step 4: When.
In the "
When selected scenario occurs, send message
" section, you can choose the scenario that will trigger the automated push message to be sent. You can set it to be sent every time the scenario occurs or only once per user.
The "
User Limit
" section allows you to set a limit on the number of users who will receive the automated push message. This can be helpful if you want to limit the number of messages being sent or if you have a limited budget for your campaign.
In the "
Total Limit
" section, you can set a limit on the total number of messages that will be sent during the campaign. This can be useful for controlling costs or managing the frequency of messages being sent to users.
The "
Message Limit
" section allows you to set a limit on the number of messages that can be sent to a single user during the campaign. This can help prevent users from being overwhelmed with too many messages.
The "
Message Expire In
the automatic cancellation feature can be activated to cancel messages that have not been received by the intended recipient within a specified time frame. This allows for a period to be set, for example, in case the recipient's internet access is unavailable or the device is turned off. If the message is not delivered by the end of this period, it will expire.
Push Time Restriction:
The automated message can be restricted to a specific time frame by setting the time interval and choosing the days on which it should be sent.
Campaign Period for User Action Notification
Push Time Restriction
Message Priority
Message Priority is a feature that allows users
to set the order
in which automated push scenarios will be sent. When multiple scenarios are set up, this feature enables users to prioritize which scenarios should be sent first. The
Priority Level
option is used to assign a level of importance to each scenario. The higher the priority level, the more important the scenario, and it will be sent first. This is useful for collapsing scenarios, where multiple messages are sent within a short period of time. By assigning priority levels to scenarios, users can ensure that the most important messages are delivered to the user first.
Option 2: Periodic Messages
Periodic messages are messages that are sent
regularly on a scheduled basis
, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. These messages can be set up to be sent at a specific time, ensuring that they reach the user at a time when they are most likely to engage with them.
One common use case for periodic messages is sending birthday messages to users. By setting up a daily periodic message, you can automatically send personalized birthday messages to users on their birthday, ensuring that they feel appreciated and valued by the app.
Periodic
In the
Weekly
option, you can select one or more days of the week when the message will be sent. For example, you might choose to send a weekly newsletter every Friday, or a reminder to complete a task every Monday and Wednesday.
Weekly
The
Monthly
option allows you to specify more specific dates, such as the first Monday or third Friday of the month. This can be useful for sending reminders or notifications that are tied to specific events, such as a monthly billing statement or a recurring appointment.
Monthly
Campaign Period
Start Time and End Time
These fields define the active period for the campaign. Messages or widgets will only be sent/displayed during this time window.
When Selected Scenario Occurs, Send Message
You can specify whether the widget is shown
every time
the condition is met or based on predefined criteria or only
once
the scenario occurs and stop showing the widget.
User Limit
Controls how many times a single user can receive the same message within a specified period.
Per Day: Limits the number of messages a user can receive in one day.
Per Week: Restricts the number of times the user can receive the message in a week.
Per Month: Prevents excessive messaging to a user within a month.
Custom Month: Allows specifying the number of messages per a custom-defined time period (e.g., 3 messages per 6 months).
You set a
User Limit
of 1
Per Day
. If a user performs an action that triggers the message multiple times a day, they’ll only receive the message once, avoiding over-communication.
Total Limit
Sets the overall cap on the number of messages sent across all users during the campaign.
Total Message Count: A numerical limit that specifies the maximum number of messages to send during the campaign.
If you run a limited promotion, you can cap the message delivery to 10,000 messages to ensure the campaign doesn’t overspend on resources or over-target users.
Message Limit
Adds a layer of control to limit how frequently a particular message is sent overall, across all users.
Per Hour: Restricts the message from being sent more than a set number of times in an hour.
Per Day: Limits daily message volume.
Per Week: Sets a weekly maximum for the message.
Per Month: Prevents excessive messaging over a longer time period.
A campaign promoting limited-time offers might set a
Message Limit
of 100 messages per hour to balance between urgency and avoiding overwhelming the system or users.
Message Expire In
Defines how long the message remains valid for delivery after being triggered.
A numerical value and time unit (e.g., hours or days) indicating the expiration period.
You set the message to expire in
6 hours
. If the triggering condition occurs at 3 PM, the message won’t be sent to users after 9 PM. This is particularly important for time-sensitive messages, such as flash sales or event reminders.
Push Time Restriction
Controls the timing and days for when messages can be sent, ensuring they’re delivered at appropriate times.
Send Only Between: Sets a start and end time for the delivery window.
Example: Between 09:00 and 18:30 ensures no messages are sent during off-hours.
Send Only On: Select specific days for message delivery (e.g., Monday-Friday for work-related notifications or Saturday-Sunday for leisure campaigns).
Delay the Push If Not Permitted: If a message is triggered outside the allowed time or day, it will be delayed and sent once the permitted window opens.
Send Based on User’s Time Zone: Dynamically adjusts the delivery window based on each user’s local time, ensuring relevance for global audiences.
You run a campaign targeting working professionals. Messages are sent between 09:00 and 18:30 from Monday to Friday. Any actions triggered outside these times are queued for delivery at the next available window.
Instant Show
(Only Applicable for Widgets and In-app Messages)
This feature ensures that a widget is displayed immediately upon the occurrence of the triggering condition. If, due to technical constraints, the widget cannot be displayed at the moment of the trigger,
it will not reappear in subsequent sessions or on other screens.
The widget appears immediately upon the user's action. However, if the widget cannot be displayed due to technical issues, it will not reattempt to show in subsequent sessions or on different screens.
In a cart abandonment scenario, the widget can be configured to instantly remind users of their abandoned cart as soon as they trigger the event. However, if the widget fails to display due to being triggered in an unsupported screen or session, it will not be reattempted in future sessions or screens.
