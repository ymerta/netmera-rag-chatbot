Sending a Mail Campaign
Step 2: What
Configure the content and settings of your email campaign on this page.
Mail Template
Select from the email templates you’ve created under
Settings > Mail Templates
. If you haven’t created any yet, refer to the
How to Create a Mail Template
guide. After selecting a template, you can edit it here to customize it for your campaign.
Email Type
Choose between two email types:
Notification:
Used to inform subscribers about events, updates, or important information.
Campaign/Advertisement:
Used to promote products, services, or special offers.
Select the type that matches the purpose of your campaign.
Important Opt-in Policy Notice
If you select
Notification
, the email will be sent to all users regardless of their email opt-in status. This option should only be used for mandatory regulatory notifications that users are required to receive. For promotional content such as product announcements or special offers, always choose
Campaign/Advertisement
to ensure the opt-in check mechanism is enforced.
From Address
Specify the sender email address that will appear to recipients. This address must be registered and transmitted to Netmera by authorized panel users.
Sender Name
Enter the name that appears as the sender. Use a recognizable name (like your company or brand) so subscribers can easily identify you as a trusted source.
Mail Subject
Write a concise, clear, and attention-grabbing subject line that accurately reflects your email content to encourage recipients to open it.
Mail Pre-header
This optional text appears next to the subject line in the inbox preview. It helps give subscribers more context and entice them to open your email. Your pre-header should be at least 40 characters.
Reply Email
Specify the email address where replies should be sent. If left blank, subscribers will not be able to reply, and no reply email will be set.
Test Mail
Before sending to your full list, test your email to check formatting, layout, and content:
Specify how many users you want to send the test to.
Add testers by making them panel users first.
Manage the test list on the
Send Test Mail
sidebar screen; you can add or remove testers, or clear the entire list with the
Clear List
button.
Send the test email by clicking
Send a Test
Test emails are sent only to these testers, ensuring the rest of your subscribers do not receive it.
Profile Attributes
Use
Profile Attributes
to target your campaign based on your contacts’ specific characteristics or data stored in their profiles. Selecting relevant attributes lets you tailor your message precisely to your audience. Please refer to the guide
Upload Email List
on transferring email lists with profile attributes to your Netmera Panel for detailed instructions.
Promotion Code
Include promotion codes or discounts to encourage desired actions from your audience, such as purchases. Choose codes from your predefined promotion value lists in Netmera. Click the
copy
button next to the code and paste it where you want it to appear in your email.
Message Label
Assign labels to your messages for better organization and reporting. This is especially useful when sending multiple campaigns or notifications. Labels allow you to filter and analyze campaign performance by categories such as product type, promotion, or target group.
Conversion Analytics
Use the
Conversion Analytics
settings to define and measure the effectiveness of your campaign by tracking user actions and conversions.
Conversion Event
Select the specific
event
that represents a successful conversion for your campaign (e.g., purchase completed, app install, form submission).
Event Attribute
Optionally, specify one or more
event attributes
to filter or segment your conversion data, allowing for more detailed analysis based on event properties.
Control Group
Enable the
control group
feature to create a subset of users who do not receive the campaign. This allows you to compare conversion rates between exposed and unexposed users and accurately calculate the campaign’s impact.
Conversion Deadline
Set a
conversion deadline
to define the time frame within which conversions will be counted after the campaign is sent. You can specify this deadline in:
Hours
Days
A custom time period
Conversion and Revenue Metrics
Conversion
: The total number of times the specified conversion event is triggered.
Revenue
: The cumulative value of the
revenue
parameter associated with the conversion event, aggregated across all users (only applicable if revenue events are integrated).
Prerequisites for Conversion and Revenue Tracking
To display conversion and revenue metrics in your campaign reports (such as email performance reports), you must define a
Conversion Event
in this step.
Additionally, to enable revenue tracking, ensure that your application sends revenue data within the relevant conversion events to Netmera. Refer to the Developer Guide for detailed integration instructions.
