No, our web push notifications are sent through Google CDN, so recalling them is not possible.
Amazon SES is the platform where you manage your sending quotas. There are two main quotas are set by Amazon SES and the exact number of email quotas change for each account.
Total number of emails that can be sent within 24 hours: This is the overall limit for the number of emails that can be sent in a 24-hour period. 

Number of emails that can be sent per second: This represents the maximum rate at which emails can be sent in one second.

We have two methods to collect uninstall data:
Google and Apple services share uninstall data with Netmera, allowing us to obtain the information.
We can also determine the uninstall status of users through silent pushes. If the silent pushes do not reach the user (e.g., due to the device being in airplane mode or having no internet connection), the user is not marked as uninstalled. You may refer toGeneral Settings#uninstall-tracking for settings.
No, such a feature is not currently available in Netmera.
