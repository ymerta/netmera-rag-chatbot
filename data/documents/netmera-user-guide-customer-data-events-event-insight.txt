to further specify your target.
Step 1. Filter Event Data
Select Your Time Period:
Begin by deciding on the timeframe for your analysis. You can choose from options like last week, month, or year. The selected timeframe will be the foundation for your analysis, determining the data range you'll examine.
Define Your Target Audience:
Identify the specific group of users you want to focus on in your analysis. You have several options:
All Users:
Analyze data for all users of your app.
Segment:
Focus on a specific user segment you've defined based on criteria like behavior, demographics, or past interactions.
Tag:
Analyze data for users who have been tagged with a particular attribute or characteristic.
Profile:
Zoom in on users with specific profiles that meet your predefined criteria.
Add Events:
To analyze user interactions, select specific events that represent actions users take within your app, such as clicks, purchases, or sign-ups. Use the search function to locate and select the event you want to analyze. Simply type in the event name or description to find it.
Add Event Properties (Optional):
For more detailed insights, you can add event properties. Event properties allow you to filter event data based on additional attributes associated with the event. Click on "Add Event Property" to specify any additional properties you want to consider in your analysis. For example, you can filter by location, device type, or custom properties you've defined.
Step 2. View Data
The Event Analytics Dashboard is a powerful tool that allows you to analyze user interactions within your app based on various events. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to use this dashboard effectively:
View Data Section
The View Data section provides two main options for analyzing events:
Total Event Count:
This option displays the total number of times each event has occurred.
Unique User Count:
This option shows the number of
distinct
users
who have performed each event.
Event Analytics Table
The table in the View Data section is organized into several columns, each providing specific information about the events and user interactions. Here's how to interpret the table:
Events Column:
This column lists the specific events you are tracking. In the example shown, the event is "Time in App."
All Total Column:
This column shows the total count of the specified event across all platforms.
Mobile and Web Columns:
These columns break down the total event count by platform and device type:
Mobile:
This includes data from iOS and Android devices.
Total:
The combined count of the event for all mobile devices.
iOS:
The count of the event specifically for iOS devices.
Android:
The count of the event specifically for Android devices.
Web:
This includes data from various web browsers.
Total:
The combined count of the event for all web browsers.
Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Other Browsers:
The count of the event for each specific web browser.
Rest, SMS, and Email Columns:
These columns would display the count of events related to REST API calls, SMS interactions, and email interactions if applicable.
Hidden Fields
The "Hidden Fields" option allows you to customize the table by hiding or displaying additional fields as needed. This feature helps you focus on the most relevant data for your analysis.
Export Function
The
Export
button at the bottom right of the screen allows you to export the data displayed in the table to an Excel file. This feature is useful for detailed examination, reporting, and further analysis outside the Netmera platform.
Dimensions
The new dimensions feature allows you to analyze events based on various criteria. Hereâ€™s how to utilize this feature:
Dimensions Dropdown:
Located under the "Dimensions" field, this dropdown menu lets you select different dimensions to analyze the events. Options include:
Month
Week
Days of a Week
Days of a Month
Hours of a Day
External ID
Custom Event Attributes
How to see different dimensions for events:
These event dimensions are determined when the event is created on Panel > Developers > Events. The event attributes you add to your custom event will be shown here, allowing you to tailor the analysis to your specific needs and gain deeper insights into user behavior. You may check
Creating Custom Events
page for further guidance.
Selecting Dimensions:
Choose a dimension from the dropdown menu to analyze how the selected events vary according to the chosen criteria. For example, selecting "Month" will show how the event count changes month by month.
Adding to Table:
After selecting a dimension, click the "Add to Table" button to include the dimension in your analysis. This will update the table to reflect the chosen dimension, providing more detailed insights into user behavior.
Example of Dimension Use:
If you select "Days of a Week," the table will show how the event count varies for each day of the week. This can help identify trends, such as higher engagement on weekends or specific days.
