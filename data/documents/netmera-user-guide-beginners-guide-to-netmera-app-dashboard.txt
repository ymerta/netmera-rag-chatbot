Active Users / Notifications
Active Users (Unique Users Opening the Application): Within the "Performance" section, you can track the number of unique users who open your application on a daily basis. This metric is crucial for understanding the reach and engagement of your app among your user base.
Notifications Sent: In the "Performance" section, you can assess the number of notifications sent from your app on a daily basis. This metric is vital for understanding your app's communication reach and the frequency of notifications being delivered to users.

Revenue / Installs / Uninstalls
Revenue: Within the "Performance" section, you can analyze the revenue generated by your app on a daily basis. This metric provides insights into the financial performance of your app and helps you track revenue trends over time. Revenue tracked in Netmera is all purchases from customers who received a push notification in the past 24 hours leading up to the purchase or clicked a notification leading to a purchase.
Installs: The "Installs" graph provides a visual representation of the number of app installations on different days of the week. This metric helps you track the distribution of app installations and understand when users are most likely to download and install your app.
Uninstalls: "Uninstall" refers to the action taken by a user to remove or delete a previously installed application (app) from their device. This metric helps you track the distribution of app removals and understand when users are more likely to uninstall your app.
Why is my Uninstall Data Increasing on Android Devices?
At Netmera, we receive device token information for your apps through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Tokens from devices that haven't connected to FCM for over 270 days become invalid. These tokens are linked to passive devices, which have likely been inactive for a long time. Messages sent to these old tokens won't be delivered.
Reasons for inactive tokens:
Devices lost, destroyed, or forgotten
Long periods of inactivity
If a token is inactive for 270 days, FCM marks it as invalid. Once a device reconnects, it gets a new token, and Netmera assigns a new installation ID. This process can lead to higher uninstall numbers, as previously successful message deliveries to these old tokens are now counted as failures. However, this change specifically impacts Android devices inactive for 270+ days.

App Conversion Rate % / Avg. Session Lenght / Avg. User Frequency
App Conversion Rate %: App Conversion Rate % is a key performance indicator (KPI) used to measure the effectiveness of your app in converting users from one stage to another within a specific action or goal. It's usually expressed as a percentage and represents the proportion of users who take a desired action out of the total number of users who had the opportunity to do so.

The formula for calculating App Conversion Rate %
((Total Number of Users Who Had the Opportunity to Complete the Action) /
(Number of Users Who Completed the Desired Action))×100%

Average Session Lenght Minutes: This graph offers a detailed view of user engagement within your app throughout the week. It tracks the average session length, measured in minutes, on each day from Monday (Mon) to Sunday (Sun). The session length represents the duration users typically spend interacting with your app during each session.
Average Usage Frequency: This graph provides a detailed analysis of user engagement patterns within your app throughout the week. It focuses on the average usage frequency of a user, highlighting how often users interact with your app on each day of the week, from Monday (Mon) to Sunday (Sun).

Revenue / Retention
This graph offers a comprehensive view of your app's financial performance and user retention rates over the last 6 months, from April (Apr) to September (Sep).
Revenue (ARPU): The upper part of the graph represents Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) on a scale from 0.00 to 1.00. ARPU measures the average revenue generated from each user during a specific period. As the months progress, you can see fluctuations in ARPU, indicating changes in the app's revenue generation.
Retention Rate: The lower part of the graph illustrates the Retention Rate, displayed as a percentage. This metric reflects the percentage of users who continue to use your app over time, relative to the total number of users. As you move from April to September, you can track how well your app is retaining users, which is crucial for sustaining long-term success.
These metrics provide valuable insights into your app's financial health and user engagement. Analyzing trends in ARPU and retention rates can inform strategic decisions to optimize your app's performance and enhance your omnichannel customer engagement strategies.
