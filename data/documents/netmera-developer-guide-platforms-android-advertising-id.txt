Ad_ID
(Advertising Identifier) for users. This device identifier allows for targeted actions that help you better understand and engage with your users, although it is not used for displaying advertisements. Instead, the Ad_ID is a key variable for tracking user interactions and behavior.

is a unique identifier tied to each user's device.
It is not used for advertisements within your app but for tracking user activity and enabling more personalized communication and campaigns.

The

method, located in the
AdvertisingIdClient.Info
class, checks whether the user has opted to limit the use of their advertising ID.
When

Returns True
If the method returns
true
, it means the user has chosen to limit the use of their advertising identifier (
