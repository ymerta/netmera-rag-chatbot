Customer Data
Device Metadata
Device metadata plays a foundational role in how Netmera enables data-driven customer engagement. This information allows businesses to:
Deliver relevant content:
By understanding the user's device, operating system, and location, you can adjust your messaging strategy to match the technical context of the recipient.
Improve segmentation accuracy:
System-level data supports the creation of dynamic audiences based on attributes like OS version, app version, device region, or language.
Enhance analytical depth:
These fields help enrich dashboards and reporting by enabling breakdowns by platform, version, manufacturer, and more.
Support targeted debugging:
Understanding which environments are affected during technical issues (e.g., crashes on specific devices or OS versions) speeds up resolution time.

Identify users on outdated versions and prompt them to upgrade.
Run A/B tests for new features based on OS or app version compatibility.
2. Region and Language-Specific Campaigns
Use
Region Code
and
Device Language
to:
Automatically localize message content according to the user’s language settings.
Filter or exclude users in unsupported countries or regions.
3. Telecom-Specific Analysis (Android Only)
Use
Operator Code
and
Operator Name
to:
Analyze user distribution by mobile carrier.
Correlate user engagement or churn with specific telecom providers.
Note:
These two fields are only available on Android and iOS versions 13 through 15.3. They are deprecated on iOS 15.4 and later due to Apple’s privacy restrictions.
4. Device-Specific Performance Analysis
Use
Device Model
and
Device Manufacturer
