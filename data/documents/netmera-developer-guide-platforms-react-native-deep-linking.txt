Deep Linking
To integrate deep link functionality into your React Native application, follow these steps:
Step 1: Consult Documentation
For detailed instructions and code samples, refer to the relevant documentation and complete deep link integration for
iOS
and
Android
Step 2: Processing Deep Links While the App is Running
Use the
Linking module
from React Native to handle deep links when the app is running. Refer to the
React Native Linking Documentation
for more details on implementation.
Use
Netmera.getInitialURL()
to catch deep links when the app is killed or in the background. Add this to your
App.tsx
file:
useEffect
(()
Netmera
.getInitialURL
.then
(url
(url) {
Toast
.show
type
'success'
text1
`Initial URL:
url
});
});
[]);
