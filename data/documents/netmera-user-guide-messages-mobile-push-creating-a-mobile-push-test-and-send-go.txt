Here comes the final step.
Once you have completed all four steps, you can access all the information related to the message created in the GO stage, and after testing with test devices, you can send it for Approval Admin approval.
Conversion analytics (What), selection criteria (Who), and schedule (When) all of which you have set before can be checked before sending your notification to your audience. If you notice a detail you want to edit, you may click on "Change" button which will guide you to the relevant step. 
On the right side of the page you can see how the push would look like on target devices. Before launching your notification, you may test your notification on your registered test devices or only on your own test device which can be edited in Settings -> Test Devices.
Tip:
This allows you to see how the notification will look on different operating systems, device types, and screen sizes. By testing the notification on different devices, you can identify any potential display issues or content errors before sending the notification to all of your users.
After checking the details and testing on your device, it's finally time to send your notification to your audience. Just click on "Send" and wait for your Reports!
