Widget and In-App Messages
Pop-up and In-App Message Presentation Behavior
All push notifications in Netmera work automaticallyâ€”no additional coding is required. However, you can
customize
pop-up presentations and
listen to push callbacks
By default, when a popup notification or in-app message is received:
If the app is in the
foreground
immediately
If the app is in the
background
when the app returns to the foreground.
Receiving Popups and In-App Messages in the Background
To receive popups or in-app messages when the application is in the background, you need to enable
Remote Notifications
under
Background Modes
Capabilities
Pop-up Presentation Logic
Enable / Disable Immediate Presentations
To prevent immediate pop-up presentation (e.g., during video playback, gaming, or checkout), use:
Disable Pop-Up
// Call this method to temporarily disable the immediate presentation of popups.
Netmera.disablePopupPresentation();
Enable Pop-Up
// Call this method to re-enable the immediate presentation of popups.
Netmera.enablePopupPresentation();
Widget URL Callbacks Integration for iOS in React Native
This is
applicable
only to
iOS for React Native
integration. To handle widget URL callbacks in React Native for iOS, follow these steps:
Step 1: Modify the AppDelegate.m file
Add the following code between
@implementation AppDelegate
and
@end
// Required code to handle widget URLs in React Native
- (BOOL)shouldHandleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url forPushObject:(NetmeraPushObject *)object {
return NO;
- (void)handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url forPushObject:(NetmeraPushObject *)object {
[RNNetmeraRCTEventEmitter handleOpenURL:url forPushObject:object];
Step 2: Use
onWidgetUrlTriggered
in React Native
In your React Native code, implement the following to handle the widget URL callback:
Netmera.onWidgetUrlTriggered(url => {
console.log('Netmera triggered widget URL: ', url);
});
This will enable widget URL callback functionality in your iOS React Native app.
