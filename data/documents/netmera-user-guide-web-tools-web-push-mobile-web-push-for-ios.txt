Web Push notifications are a powerful tool for engaging users and driving traffic to a website or platform. With the introduction of iOS and iPadOS 16.4+, marketers can now leverage web push notifications on these devices. This allows for a wider reach and enhanced user engagement through web apps added to a user's home screen.
Step 1: Application Configuration
Before creating Mobile Web Push notifications, ensure your application is properly set up. Please refer to the Developer Guide for detailed configuration steps.
Step 2: Users Add Your Website to Their Home Screens
For users to receive web push notifications, they must add your website to their home screen. This step is crucial, as web push notifications on iOS only work for home screen web apps.
User Steps:
Open the website on an iOS/iPadOS 16.4+ device.
Click the Share button.
Select Add to Home Screen.
Save the app on the device home screen.
Open the app from the home screen.
Subscribe to notifications via the Fancy Box.
The native permission prompt should appear when the subscribe button is clicked.
Step 3: Granting Push Permission
Once the website is added to the home screen, users must allow push notifications to start receiving alerts.
Users open the app from the home screen.
The website triggers a Fancy Box requesting push notification permissions.
Users must grant permission to receive web push notifications.
Step 4: Sending a Web Push Notification for iOS
Once users have granted push permissions, notifications can be sent using the Netmera Panel.
Steps to Send a Notification
Navigate to the Netmera Panel.
Select Create New Campaign > Web > Safari to configure and send notifications to iOS users.
Web Push notifications on iOS and iPadOS open up new opportunities for customer engagement. By following these steps, you can increase retention, improve conversions, and keep users informed in real-time.
