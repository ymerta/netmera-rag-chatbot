Installs
The
Installs & Uninstalls
dashboard provides key insights into user acquisition, engagement, and churn trends. By tracking these metrics across daily, weekly, or monthly timeframes, you can better understand user behavior and make data-driven decisions to optimize growth and retention.
Installs
The
Installs
metric represents the number of new users who have installed your platform or application within the selected timeframe. Tracking installs on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis helps you evaluate the effectiveness of your strategies for attracting new users.
A consistently high install rate indicates strong acquisition strategies, while fluctuations may signal the need for adjustments in marketing, promotions, or app store visibility.
Reinstalls
Reinstalls
track users who previously uninstalled the app but have reinstalled it within the given timeframe. This metric provides insights into user re-engagement and brand loyalty.
A high reinstall rate may indicate users reconsidering your platform after initial disengagement. Analyzing reinstall trends can help optimize re-engagement campaigns and improve retention strategies.
Uninstalls
The
Uninstalls
metric reflects the number of users who have removed your platform or application from their devices. Tracking uninstall trends helps identify potential issues affecting user retention, such as onboarding friction, performance issues, or lack of engagement.
High uninstall rates could indicate usability challenges, unmet expectations, or onboarding gaps. Consider conducting A/B tests, optimizing user flows, or gathering feedback from churned users to enhance the experience.
Understanding Android Uninstall Data Fluctuations
In some cases, an increase in uninstalls on
Android
devices may be linked to
inactive device tokens
rather than actual user churn.
At Netmera, we receive device token data through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). When a device remains inactive for
270+ days
, FCM invalidates its token. If a previously inactive user returns, a new token and installation ID are assigned, which may contribute to higher uninstall counts.
Common causes of inactive tokens:
Devices that are lost, broken, or no longer in use
Extended periods of inactivity without connecting to FCM
Impact:
If your dashboard shows an increase in uninstalls, it may not always indicate active users leaving the platformâ€”it could result from these token resets.
Using These Metrics to Improve User Retention
By analyzing installs, reinstalls, and uninstalls together, you can:
Identify trends in user acquisition and churn
Optimize re-engagement campaigns to win back lost users
Improve onboarding and in-app experiences to reduce uninstall rates
Tracking these insights allows you to make
data-driven improvements
that enhance user satisfaction, engagement, and long-term platform growth.
