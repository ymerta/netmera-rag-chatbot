Sending a Mail Campaign
Step 3: Who
In this step, you define the target audience for your email campaign. You can send the email to all users or narrow the audience by using the options
Send All
Select Users
Advanced
, or
Distribution List
(explained below).
Send All
Select this option to send your email to
all subscribers
who have opted in (if the campaign type is Campaign/Announcement) to receive your e-mails.
Select Users
Target specific users based on criteria such as location, language, and other basic filters.
User Filtering
Tag
You can segment your users based on tags that you have created in the 'Targeting->Tags' section. Once you have added at least two tags, you can modify your tag preference using 'And/Or' logical operators. This allows you to refine your targeting and reach specific groups of users who share certain characteristics or behaviors.
Segment
Segments are groups of users that are dynamically structured. Based on the actions they take on the app, users can either enter or exit these segments. In this section you can seperate your users by their segment. After adding at least 2 parameters, you can modify your segment preference with "
And/Or
" logical operators. Also you can add new segments from "
Targeting->Segments
". To learn more, please refer to the
Define Segment
section.
Device Type
You can separate your users by their device type, such as
Desktop, Mobile, Tablet
. Additionally, you can modify your device type preference using logical operators "And/Or" after adding at least 2 parameters. This allows for greater flexibility in targeting specific groups of users based on their device type.
Profile
The users whoâ€™s specified profile attribute is equal to specified value. This refers to a targeting option where you can select users whose specific profile attribute matches a particular value. For example, you can select users whose "gender" attribute is equal to "female" or users whose "age" attribute is equal to "25". After adding at least 2 parameters, you can modify your profile attribute preference with "
And/Or
" logical operators.
Response
The targeting for the push notification will be based on users who either did or did not interact with a specific previous push notification. For example, if you select a previous push notification that advertised a sale and then choose to target users who did not interact with it, your new push notification might offer a different promotion to try to entice those users who didn't take advantage of the previous sale.
Location
This targeting option allows you to select users based on their geographic location. You can specify a region, such as a city, state, or country, and target users who are located within that area. You can search location by its latitude and longitude. Or you can just simply serch by the location name. Also from distance part you can select the radius value and type for your location then by clicking on map you can select your location by determined radius.
Advanced
This option allows for more granular targeting based on user behaviors and actions on your website or app. You can create highly personalized campaigns by defining conditions and groups.
Use
Add Condition
Add Group
to specify targeting rules.
Multiple conditions/groups can be combined using
AND
logic:
AND
: Users must meet all conditions/groups to be included.
: Users who meet any condition/group will be included.
The right section displays the resulting target audience based on your criteria.
The
Selection Criteria
summary shows the number of users your campaign will reach.
Ignore User Message Limits
This option allows sending emails to users who have exceeded normal message limits (set to prevent spam or overload). Use this only for urgent or time-sensitive messages, as overusing it can increase user annoyance and opt-outs.
Limit Target Users
Enable this option to set a maximum number of users who will receive the campaign. This is useful when:
Controlling campaign reach to avoid exceeding inventory or capacity (e.g., limited-time offers).
Running tests with a smaller audience before a full rollout.
Once the limit is reached, no additional users will receive the message, even if they match the targeting criteria.
