Types of Mobile Push Notifications

Types of Push Notifications
Text
Text notifications contain only text, making them quick and easy to read. They are suitable for delivering essential updates such as account changes, limited-time offers, or breaking news alerts. While they are limited in terms of visual content, their simplicity makes them ideal for clear and urgent communication.
Image
Image notifications include visual elements such as images or videos. These can be used to make your message more engaging and visually appealing. For example, you can showcase a product image, display a promotional banner, or highlight travel destinations. Although these notifications draw more attention, they may not be suitable for conveying detailed information, and users may need to tap through to get the full context.
Banner (Android only)
Banner notifications are supported on Android devices and allow you to display custom content directly on specific screens within your app. This format is useful for drawing attention to urgent updates such as weather alerts or time-sensitive news. Banners are prominent and informative, but should be used thoughtfully, as overuse can affect the user experience.
Carousel
Carousel notifications allow you to present multiple pieces of content within a single message. Users can swipe through different items, such as a selection of products, articles, or media. This format works well when you want to showcase several related items at once. It offers an interactive experience, but including too much content can make the message overwhelming.
Slider
Slider notifications let users switch between content items in a scrollable format. They are especially useful for highlighting a group of products, promoting a music playlist, or guiding users through a fitness routine. While similar to carousels, slider notifications focus more on product exploration within a single message. Depending on your content type, this format may or may not be the right fit for your goals.
Product Discovery (Android only)
Product discovery notifications display product details directly within the message, allowing users to view rich content without needing to open the app. This format is ideal for personalized product recommendations based on user behavior, such as recent views or purchase history. As this feature is only available on Android devices, it's best used in campaigns that target this user group specifically.
                                          
Choosing the Right Format
Each notification type offers different advantages depending on the message you want to send and the experience you want to create. Text-based formats provide simplicity and speed. Media-rich formats increase engagement. Interactive formats like carousels and sliders allow users to explore multiple items in one message. Android-specific formats such as banners and product discovery notifications provide additional opportunities for targeting and customization.
