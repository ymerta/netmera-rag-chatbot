Text
This type of notification is plain text, but it's still very useful for sending important information to your users. For example, a news app could send a text notification with the latest breaking news stories, a banking app could send an alert about low account balance, and a retail app could send a notification with a discount code or special offer.

This type of notification lets you include images or videos in your message. It's a great way to make your notifications more eye-catching and engaging. You could use it to send an image notification featuring a new product to entice your users to visit your app and make a purchase, or send a beautiful picture of a vacation destination to inspire your users to book a trip.
Banner
This type of notification is only available on Android devices, but it's a great way to create custom content that can be displayed on the main screen of your app or on specific pages. You could use it to promptly alert users about weather emergencies or severe weather conditions, providing important information to ensure user safety. A news app could also send a banner notification to inform the user about breaking news, while a sports app could use it to alert users about a score update or when their favorite team is playing.
Carousel
This type of notification lets you display multiple images or text in a single message that users can swipe through. It's a great way to showcase different products or destinations in a single notification. You could use it to send a carousel notification with different movies or TV shows, or showcase different products on sale in a shopping app.
Slider
This type of notification allows users to switch between products in a message. Multiple products can be added in a single notification, making it a great way to promote new items or encourage users to complete a workout challenge. You could use it to send a slider notification promoting a new album or song in a music app, or showcasing a new dish or recipe in a food app.
Product Discovery
This type of notification is only available on Android devices, and it contains details about a specific product that users can view directly from the notification. You could use it to recommend outfits based on a user's recent browsing history in a fashion app, suggest products that are similar to items a user has previously purchased in an e-commerce app, or recommend skincare products based on a user's skin type and concerns in a beauty app.
