v4.6.0
July 3, 2025
implementation platform('com.netmera:netmera-bom:4.6.0')
implementation 'com.netmera:nmcore'
implementation 'com.netmera:nmfcm'
implementation 'com.netmera:nmhms'
Improvements
Unified WebView Behavior on Push Clicks:
push notification clicks
with that of popup-based widgets.
Even if the
enablePopup
permission is disabled, the WebView will open using the same mechanism as the popup widget. This ensures a
consistent experience
across push flows.
New Permission Management Methods Added:
The following methods have been introduced to allow developers to
get and set user communication permissions
programmatically:
getEmailPermission()
setEmailPermission(boolean)
getSmsPermission()
setSmsPermission(boolean)
Android Email & SMS Preferences
These APIs provide
greater control
over user consent states and make it easier to build GDPR/permission-aware flows within your app.
v4.5.0
June 18, 2025
Starting from
v4.5.0
implementation 'com.netmera:nmcore:4.5.0'
implementation 'com.netmera:nmfcm:4.5.0'
implementation 'com.netmera:nmhms:4.5.0'
Important:
When upgrading to
nmcore:4.5.0
, make sure to also upgrade
nmfcm
and
nmhms
to the
same version (4.5.0)
to maintain compatibility.
BOM (Bill of Materials) Support
We've introduced
BOM structure
You can implement Netmera modules like this:
implementation platform('com.netmera:netmera-bom:4.5.0')
implementation 'com.netmera:nmcore'
implementation 'com.netmera:nmfcm'
implementation 'com.netmera:nmhms'
This ensures all dependencies automatically align with the correct version, reducing the risk of mismatches.
‚≠ê Improvements

updateUserProfile
: Should be used for updating user
profile attributes
identifyUser
: Should be used for setting or updating
user identifiers
such as
userId
email
, or
msisdn
session
and
init
requests are sent
with a callback
, improving reliability and traceability.

implementation 'com.netmera:nmhms:4.0.1'
Integration Notes for Custom FCM and HMS Implementations
If your platform uses a
custom
FirebaseMessagingService
HmsMessageService
, you need to update your
AndroidManifest.xml
file to avoid service conflicts with Netmera.
1. Manifest Configuration
For Custom
FirebaseMessagingService
If you are using your own
FirebaseMessagingService
class, make sure to add the following line to your
AndroidManifest.xml
to remove Netmera's default FCM service:
<service
android:name="com.netmera.nmfcm.NMFirebaseService"
tools:node="remove" />
For Custom
HmsMessageService
If you are using your own
HmsMessageService
class, include the following entry in your manifest to remove Netmera‚Äôs default HMS service:
<service
android:name="com.netmera.nmhms.NMHuaweiService"
tools:node="remove" />
2. Handling Push Messages
Starting from
, the method:
Netmera.isNetmeraRemoteMessage(remoteMessage)
has been
deprecated
. Please update your implementation as shown in title 3.
Before (Deprecated in 4.0.12):
override fun onMessageReceived(remoteMessage: RemoteMessage) {
super.onMessageReceived(remoteMessage)
if (Netmera.isNetmeraRemoteMessage(remoteMessage)) {
Netmera.onNetmeraPushMessageReceived(remoteMessage)
} else {
// Handle other messages
3. Updated Implementations
For Custom
FirebaseMessagingService
(FCM):
override fun onMessageReceived(remoteMessage: RemoteMessage) {
super.onMessageReceived(remoteMessage)
if (Netmera.isNetmeraRemoteMessage(remoteMessage.data)) {
Netmera.onNetmeraPushMessageReceived(remoteMessage)
} else {
// Handle other messages
For Custom
HmsMessageService
(HMS):
override fun onMessageReceived(remoteMessage: RemoteMessage) {
super.onMessageReceived(remoteMessage)
if (Netmera.isNetmeraRemoteMessage(remoteMessage.dataOfMap)) {
Netmera.onNetmeraPushMessageReceived(remoteMessage)
} else {
// Handle other messages
v4.0.11
March 28, 2025
‚≠ê Improvements
Added the ability to disable the
Boot Receiver module
, providing greater flexibility in managing its behavior based on application requirements.
Implementation
To disable the Boot Receiver, add the following code block to your
AndroidManifest.xml
file:
<receiver
android:name="com.netmera.NetmeraBootReceiver"
tools:node="remove"/>

v3.15.3
November 1, 2024
‚≠ê Improvements

checkNotificationPermission
method.

Improved the kill method functionality, allowing it to work even in scenarios where the
init
method has not been called.
v3.15.1
October 14, 2024
Features
Notification Permission Check:
Added the
checkNotificationPermission
Notification Permission Handling with
Netmera.checkNotificationPermission()
The
Netmera.checkNotificationPermission()
method provides insight into the user's current notification permission status. Based on the response, it returns one of the following statuses:
DENIED
, or
GRANTED
. This allows you to tailor the notification permission request flow and improve user experience:
Notification permission is blocked by the system settings, meaning the user has previously disallowed notifications at the system level. In this case, additional permission requests cannot be shown to the user directly. You may consider guiding the user to the settings page to enable notifications manually.
DENIED:
The user was previously asked for notification permission but declined. You may choose to request permission again, but it‚Äôs important to approach this carefully to avoid annoying the user. Consider implementing a gradual or conditional re-prompt strategy based on user actions.
GRANTED:
The user has granted notification permission. The application can now send notifications without the need for further permission checks, allowing seamless user engagement through push notifications.
By using
Netmera.checkNotificationPermission()
, you can manage calls to
requestNotificationPermission()
more effectively based on the permission status, resulting in a more thoughtful and user-centric approach to notification permissions.
‚≠ê Improvements
Notification Permission Handling:
Updated the
requestNotificationPermission
method to redirect users to settings on the third and subsequent calls, enhancing the permission request flow.
üõ† Bug Fixes
Media Content in Push Notifications:
Fixed an issue where media content in push notifications was not loading on some devices, ensuring more consistent media display.
Widget Background Color:
Resolved an issue where sending widgets back-to-back caused the background to turn white unexpectedly.
Delayed Web Page Pushes:
Addressed an issue where "Show Web Page" push notifications were opening slowly or failing to open, improving response time and reliability.
App Tracker Limit Issue:
Fixed an issue where the app tracker failed when the
app tracked list
Item Click Action for Web Pages:
Resolved a problem where the app wouldn‚Äôt open when "Show Web Page" was selected as the item click action, ensuring correct behavior on selection.
We recommend updating to this version to benefit from these new features, improvements, and fixes, which enhance performance, reliability, and user experience.

Features
SSL Pinning Support:
Added SSL pinning to enhance security. This feature allows specifying trusted SSL certificates for secure communication.
To configure SSL pinning, use the following example code:
Single SSL Pin:
NetmeraConfiguration.Builder configBuilder = new NetmeraConfiguration.Builder();
configBuilder.baseUrl(baseUrl)
.huaweiSenderId(PropertiesUtil.huaweiSenderId)
.firebaseSenderId(PropertiesUtil.gcmSenderId)

configBuilder.baseUrl(baseUrl)
.huaweiSenderId(PropertiesUtil.huaweiSenderId)
