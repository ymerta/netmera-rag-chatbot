Step 1: Coupon Code Lists
Begin by navigating to the "Settings" page in the menu.
Within the "Settings" page, you'll notice a new section titled "
Coupon Code Lists
" Click on this section to access the coupon code management page. This is where you can efficiently manage and oversee your coupon codes for various promotional campaigns.

List Name:
Each code is clearly displayed for easy reference.
Available Coupons:
You can see the quantity of codes that are currently available for use.
Expiry Date:
Allows you to track when the codes will no longer be valid.
Step 3: Upload Coupon Code List
List Name:
Begin by entering a name for your coupon code list. This name will be displayed in the "Coupon Codes List" section, making it easier for you to identify and manage your lists.
Coupon Codes:
Option 1: Fixed Coupon Code
Fixed coupon codes are a type of coupon code
where every user receives the same exact code
. In other words, there is no variation in the coupon code provided to different users; it remains consistent for all recipients. Here's a breakdown of how fixed coupon codes work
Select this option if you want to provide the same coupon code to every user. Specify the number of codes you wish to generate.
Fixed Coupon Code Example:
Fixed coupon codes are often used for promotions or campaigns where all customers are offered the same discount or benefit. For instance, if you're running a site-wide sale and want every customer to receive a 10% discount, you can create a fixed coupon code for that purpose.
Option 2: Coupon List
When you choose the "Coupon List" option, you're essentially saying that you want to provide individual, unique coupon codes to users from a list you've prepared in advance. This option is useful when you want to
provide distinct offers to different users or when you have a predetermined set of unique coupon codes
that you want to distribute through your campaign. It's a way to ensure that each user gets a code that hasn't been used by someone else. Here's how this works:
You need to create a list of coupon codes in advance. Each code should be on a separate line in a text file (.txt file). This list can include as many codes as you need, and each code can offer different discounts or benefits.
After uploading your list, Netmera will distribute these individual codes to users. Each user will receive a different code from the list, ensuring that the coupons are unique.
Coupon List File Format:
Ensure that your
.txt f
ile follows the specified format, with
each coupon code on a separate row
. This format is crucial for the system to process the codes correctly.
Warning Limit
The Warning Limit is a feature that allows you to set a predefined threshold for the number of available coupon codes in your list. When the actual quantity of available coupon codes in the list falls below this threshold, the system will automatically send warning emails to notify you.
Here's how it works:
Threshold Setting:
You can specify a numeric value as the Warning Limit. For example, if you set the Warning Limit to 50, it means that when the number of available coupon codes in your list drops to 50 or lower, the system will trigger a warning.
Email Notifications:
When the system detects that your available coupon codes have reached or fallen below the Warning Limit, it will send email notifications to a designated recipient.
Purpose:
The purpose of this feature is to keep you informed about the status of your coupon code inventory. It ensures that you are aware when the availability of coupon codes is running low. This proactive alert system allows you to take timely action, such as replenishing the coupon codes, to avoid any disruptions in your promotional campaigns.
Expiry Date
The Expiry Date is the specific date on which your coupon code list will no longer be valid for use. It marks the endpoint of the period during which the coupon codes within this list can be redeemed. This feature allows you to set a clear and defined timeframe for the availability of your coupon codes, ensuring that they remain active only until the chosen expiration date.
Upload Coupon
In the following steps, you have the option to choose between sending coupon codes via SMS or push notifications. These methods can be toggled on or off based on your preference, allowing you to select the most suitable method for your campaign.
Send SMS
Determine if coupon codes will be sent via SMS. The SMS text and placeholders for the coupon code and expiry date are predefined and cannot be customized. Use the pre-made profile attributes for the coupon code and expiry date that you have created before.
Needs SMS Integration:
It's crucial to note that in order to utilize the SMS option for sending coupon codes, you must first integrate Netmera for SMS campaigns. This integration allows for efficient distribution of coupon codes via SMS. You may refer to the following guide for SMS Onboarding:
