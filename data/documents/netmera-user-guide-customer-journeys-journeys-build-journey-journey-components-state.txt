State
Create the Flow and Timing of User Interactions
The State section in the Journey module comprises various components that dictate the flow and timing of user interactions within a journey. Below are the components available under the State section, detailed for user comprehension and guidance. For now, we are going to cover the two components: On Event, and Delay. However, when we launch Attribute Wait and On Interaction, you will be able to see their guides also here! ☺️

On Event
In this step of the Journey, you define the event that must occur before the Journey progresses. For example, consider a scenario where users apply for a credit. You would select the Credit Application event as the trigger. This means the Journey will proceed once the user submits a credit application.

Step Name
This is where you name the specific step in the Journey. In this case, the step is labeled Event, which helps identify and organize the stages within the Journey.
Select Event
Here, you select the event that will trigger the Journey to proceed to the next step. The example shows Credit Application as the event. Once the Journey starts, this event cannot be changed. This ensures consistency throughout the Journey.
Add Trigger Filters
Trigger filters allow you to refine the event by adding conditions. In this example, the Amount property is chosen, and the filter is set to trigger only when the Amount is Greater Than 10,000. This allows you to focus only on events that meet specific criteria, such as credit applications above a certain amount.
Add Journey Value
You can save specific data from this step as a Journey Value. For instance, you may want to store the amount requested by the user during their credit application to personalize future communications. Simply select the property (e.g., Amount) and save it as a Journey Value for later use.
Add Correlation
If there is a need to correlate events with other attributes, such as matching multiple data points (e.g., amount requested and approved), you can use the Add Correlation option. In this case, you would correlate the Amount property to further refine how this Journey step interacts with other data.

Time-out
You also have the option to set a Time-out for the events. The Time-out specifies the maximum time allowed for the event to occur before the Journey takes an alternate path or ends. For example, if the credit application doesn’t happen within a set time (e.g., 48 hours), the Journey can proceed with a different action, such as sending a reminder to the user.

Delay
The Delay component pauses the journey for a set amount of time before proceeding to the next step. You might want to wait for a few days before sending a follow-up email after a user has made a purchase to ask for feedback or suggest related products. You can set the duration of the delay in minutes, hours, days, or even weeks, depending on your specific requirements.

Step Name
This is where you define the name of the delay step. In the example, it's named Delay. Naming steps clearly is essential for organizing and tracking the flow of the Journey.
Select Type of Delay
Here, you choose how the delay will be implemented. 
Fixed Duration
The example shows Fixed Duration, which means that the delay will last for a set amount of time. You can delay users by seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or years. Fixed Duration is useful for defining specific time gaps between two Journey actions.

Until Date
This option delays users until a specific calendar date. When selected, you can define an exact date, and users will wait in the journey until that date arrives before moving forward. It is useful for time-sensitive campaigns or actions that should be aligned with specific events, such as holidays, end-of-month promotions, or any other date-centric activity.
Example: If a user enters a journey on September 15th, and you set the delay Until Date to September 23rd, that user will remain in the delay step until the 23rd before proceeding, no matter when they started the journey.

Until Day of Week
This option delays users until a specific day of the week and hour. It is useful for workflows where actions need to happen on a consistent weekday. You select the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday), and the system holds users at this step until that day and hour arrives.
Example: If you set a delay for Until Day of Week: Tuesday 00:00, any user entering this step on, say, a Sunday will remain delayed until the following Tuesday. This is useful for weekly campaigns or timed messages.
