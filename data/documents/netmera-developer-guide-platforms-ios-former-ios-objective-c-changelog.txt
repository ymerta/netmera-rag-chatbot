FEATURE
SSL Pinning Support:
Added support for SSL Pinning allowing developers to enable SSL pinning when needed. This feature enhances the security of your application by ensuring trusted communication channels.
SSL Pinning for iOS 14 and Above
To enhance the security of your iOS application, SSL pinning is recommended, particularly for devices running iOS 14 and above. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
1. Store Certificates Within the Application
SSL pinning involves storing a specific certificate or a certificate chain within the app bundle. You need to add this certificate to the application bundle to authenticate communication between your app and the server.
Steps to Add the Certificate:
Download the certificate in
.cer
format.
In Xcode, right-click on your project name in the Project Navigator.
Select
"Add Files to [project name]"
and choose the downloaded
.cer
file.
2. Configure Network Security Settings
To optimize security and performance on iOS 14 and above, apply the following configurations in your app:
App Transport Security (ATS):
Apple’s ATS feature requires apps to communicate securely over HTTPS, providing an added layer of security when used with SSL pinning.
Configure ATS in your app’s
Info.plist
file as follows to ensure strict security compliance:
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
<false/>
</dict>
This setting ensures that all communications conform to HTTPS standards, making SSL pinning more robust.
SSL Pinning for iOS 13 and Earlier
For devices running
iOS 13 and earlier
, follow these steps:
Add the
netmera.com.cer
file to your project’s target.
No additional configuration is required for these versions.
This ensures compatibility across various iOS versions while maintaining security standards for iOS 14 and above.
Important Note on File Name:
The certificate file
must be named
netmera.com.cer
Do not rename
the file, as the application relies on the exact file name for proper functionality.

Details
Problem: None of the original application lifecycle methods in SwiftUI are being triggered.
SwiftUI is a framework introduced by Apple in 2019, which allows developers to create applications with a single design that can be used across devices such as iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
The issue has been investigated and development has been carried out to address the problem in both SwiftUI and traditional application frameworks, ensuring compatibility for all types of applications.
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any], fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void)
[//Netmera.recentPushObject](<https://netmera.recentpushobject/>)()?.alert.body                  //Push Text
[//Netmera.recentPushObject](<https://netmera.recentpushobject/>)()?.alert.title                 //Push Title
