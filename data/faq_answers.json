    "event_value_changes": {
      "question": "Why does my Event Values change over time?",
      "answer": "When filtering for the same event over the same date range on different days, you might notice variations in the reported values. This is due to how our system manages offline events: Offline Event Handling: When a user logs in while offline, the event is recorded with the correct timestamp and stored locally.Synchronization: Once the device reconnects to the internet, or when the user logs in again, these offline events are sent to our database.As a result, you may see an increase in event values over time as offline events are processed and added to the data. This means that values for the same date range may grow as more data becomes available. The benefits of this approach are:Maintain Data Accuracy: By recording events with their original timestamps, we ensure accurate reflection of all user actions, even if they occur while offline.Enhance Reliability: Storing events locally prevents data loss during temporary connectivity issues, providing a more complete view of user interactions.This method allows us to deliver accurate and reliable data, accommodating users' varying connectivity conditions.",

    "funnel_data_variation": {
      "question": "Why do I see some variations of data in a Funnel?",
      "answer": "To improve page performance, we use a calculation module that processes data efficiently. As a result, some variations in data may occur as the number of events and users in a funnel increases. These variations can appear both positively and negatively. For instance, adding a single event to a funnel might show a different user count compared to when additional events are included. The user count can decrease or increase slightly as more steps or data are added.Despite these minor variations, the standard level of discrepancy is very low, and the funnel data remains highly reliable for analysis. If exact user data is required, you can export the data to obtain precise figures. The export provides accurate information not affected by the on-screen display discrepancies.Note on Exported Data:In cases where export data appears shows lower data than on-screen Funnel page, there are a few potential reasons:Standard Discrepancy: The discrepancy might be more noticeable in export data due to the upward variation compared to the on-screen data. This means that the export may sometimes show less data than the on-screen display.Excluded User Data: If users who previously triggered events are no longer registered in the system (e.g., they have been removed or their data has been deleted), their information will not appear in the export. Consequently, if tags or external IDs are used for export, the data will not include them because these users are no longer available.",

If the silent pushes do not reach the user (e.g., due to the device being in airplane mode or having no internet connection), the user is not marked as uninstalled.",

    "uninstall_data_android": {
      "question": "Why is my Uninstall Data Increasing on Android Devices?",
      "answer": "At Netmera, we receive device token information for your apps through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Tokens from devices that haven't connected to FCM for over 270 days become invalid. These tokens are linked to passive devices, which have likely been inactive for a long time. Messages sent to these old tokens won't be delivered.Reasons for inactive tokens: Devices lost, destroyed, or forgottenLong periods of inactivity If a token is inactive for 270 days, FCM marks it as invalid. Once a device reconnects, it gets a new token, and Netmera assigns a new installation ID. This process can lead to higher uninstall numbers, as previously successful message deliveries to these old tokens are now counted as failures. However, this change specifically impacts Android devices inactive for 270+ days.",

These user IDs persist as unique identifiers on the user’s browser until cookies are cleared.
