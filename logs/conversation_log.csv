This can lead to minor variations in data, both positively and negatively, as the number of events and users in a funnel increases. Additionally, discrepancies may occur due to changes in the number of events processed or users included in the funnel. For instance, adding more events to a funnel can slightly alter user counts.  The level of discrepancy in funnel data is generally low, typically ranging from 0.006% to 0.4%, depending on the size of the user base involved. Despite these minor variations, the data remains highly reliable for analysis. If precise user data is needed, exporting the data can provide accurate figures without on-screen discrepancies.  📄 **Kaynak belge**: [netmera-user-guide-beginners-guide-to-netmera-faq.txt](https://user.netmera.com/netmera-user-guide/beginners-guide-to-netmera/faqs)"
